She credits a lot of herself to her father.  Since she is one of the most intelligent, funny, compassionate, Jewish, wonderful people I know, I can simply say that I really wished to have met this man.<br /><br />There is much I owe to Jessica and her circle of friends and family.  I've only met a few of you, and thanks to my own nature, I'm often distant.  I miss you guys and pray that there might be something I could do.
