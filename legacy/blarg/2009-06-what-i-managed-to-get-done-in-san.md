1. <s>Visit my friend Daryl Spitzer in Palo Alto for lunch at VMWare.</s><br /><br />Wednesday, June 3rd I ate dinner at Pluto's in Palo Alto with <a href="http://yacitus.com/">Daryl Spitzer</a> and Zain Memon. It was good catching up!<br /><br />2. <s>Rent a bike at fisherman's wharf and go mountain biking on the trails of Angel island in the bay.</s><br /><br />Thursday, June 4th me and Zain cycled Perimeter Road on Angel Island on rented bikes (get the rentals on the island since they don't ask for a hefty down payment). The views were incredible.<br /><br />3. <s>Rent a bike at fisherman's wharf and go road biking through the hills of the Marin Headlands.</s><br /><br />Well, actually I did not do this, but instead on Tuesday, June 2nd I bike the Golden gate bridge, through Sausalito, up to Old Mill park, through Tiburon, and up into Belvedere (which has a monster hill that pushed me to my limits).<br /><br />4. <s>Spend some time at Fisherman's wharf since I'll be there for the bikes anyway.</s><br /><br />Best seafood place there by far is Nick's, a hole in the wall where the cook is on the sidewalk. Ignore the pricey tourist traps and go to Nick's!<br /><br />5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Go to the Exploratorium</span><br /><br />Fail!<br /><br />6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Go to the SFMOMA</span><br /><br />Fail!<br /><br />7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rent a cheap hotel room somewhere and then wake up at dawn to watch the sun rise over Golden Gate or something.</span><br /><br />Fail!<br /><br />8. <s>See Alcatraz.</s><br /><br />Went with <a href="http://www.djangrrl.com/">Barbara Shaurette</a> on Sunday, June 7th. I was tired from walking around San Francisco for many awesome hours the day before, but it was worth it.<br /><br />9. <span style="font-style: italic;">See giant trees in Muir Forest.</span><br /><br />Fail! But I did see some pretty decent sized trees in Old Mill Park.<br /><br />Images can be found here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/tags/sanfrancisco/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/tags/sanfrancisco/</a><br /><br />Lots more detail to come!
