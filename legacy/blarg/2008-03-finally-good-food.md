title: Finally, good food!

Ate at a place a mile's walk from the conference center.  It served Chicago stle pizza, complete with cornbread dusted place.  It was packed full of Chicago folks and when we got served we found why.<br /><br />Good sauce on top, decent quality cheese, and the crust just plain tasted right.  On the veggie pizza I ate around the onions since those had over-cooked.  But the brocolli was perfect.  The sausage/spinach pizza had the normal sort of bland pepperoni but the sausage was real good.<br /><br />It ended up being about $15 a person, roughly comparable to a pizza meal in Naples, Italy.<br /><br />They also offered Pizza Beer there, flavored with basil and other things, but none of us had the nerve to try it.
