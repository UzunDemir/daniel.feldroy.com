title: Hiring and Managing Devs in Africa
description: I discuss hiring and managing software developers in Africa  
---

Over the years I've hired and managed over fifty engineers from various African countries to work for American companies. In this article I'm going to share lessons learned.

## Why Hire Africans?

There's a number of very good reasons to hire people in Africa:

### 1. Talent

Over the years I've been told that Russian, Chinese, Polish, Indian, English, Argentinean, San Franciscoans, and so on are the best you can get. Having encountered scores of nationalities in my industry, here's what I've learned over time:

1. Anywhere I've gone or any group of people I've talked to has included brilliant people from whom I've learned a lot.
2. Anywhere I've gone or any group of people I've talked to has included people for who just weren't cut out for this career.

Of course this includes people from Africa.

### 2. Cost

In general the cost of living is much less in Africa than in the USA. The rate of a software engineer in the rural midwest is a very good rate for someone living in Africa. Of course, if you have the budget for it, I recommend not discriminating by location.

### 3. Timezones

In the Western Hemisphere one of the challenges of hiring and working with Asian developers is that the middle of the day for us is the middle of the night for them. While this is useful for organizations needing 24 hour maintenance, it's mediocre to awful for organizations whose primary business hours are 9AM to 5PM. Hiring in Africa means a timezone difference of 5-8 hours. That's very manageable, especially if you define expectations for working hours on job listings.
