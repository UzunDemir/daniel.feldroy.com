# About Me

I'm probably best known as "[pydanny](https://www.google.com/search?q=pydanny)" and/or one of the authors of [Two Scoops of Django](/books/tech).

I love to read, write [books](/books), hang out with my [wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com/), [get fit](/fitness), and play with my [daughter](/tags/uma). I enjoy reading about space exploration, composting, and [potato gardening](/posts/growing-potatoes-in-southern-california). I work at [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/) to address [global climate change](/tags/climate-change).

## About this site

This site is written mostly using NextJS. This is my first React project, which I learned in May 2021 to build out [Octopus Energy US](https://octopusenergy.com). There are a number of Python scripts that support it.

The source code is on [github](https://github.com/pydanny/daniel.feldroy.com).
