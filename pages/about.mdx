# About Me

I do Python and JavaScript out of Los Angeles, California, soon to be Houston, Texas. I love to read, write, hang out with my wife, and play with my daughter. I enjoy reading about space exploration, composting, and potato gardening. I work at [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/) to address global climate change. I also write [books](/books).
