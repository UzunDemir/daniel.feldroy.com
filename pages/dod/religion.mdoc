# Religion of the Dominion of the Dead

Dark Gods of Undeath and the Necromancer Kings are honored in temples everywhere. However, there's also the illegal gods of life, worshiped quietly by those who remember the old ways or want to challenge the status quo.

## Gods of Death

Temples to the dieties of death are everywhere, and it is often said that every grave is a shrine to the cause of undeath.
