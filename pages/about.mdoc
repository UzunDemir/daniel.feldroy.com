# About Me

I'm probably best known as "[pydanny](https://www.google.com/search?q=pydanny)", one of the authors of [Two Scoops of Django](/books/tech).

I love to hang out with my [wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com/), play with my [daughter](/tags/uma), do [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://academyofbrazilianjiujitsu.com/), write [books](/books), and read books. I'm a director of engineering at renewable energy company [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/) working to address [global climate change](/tags/climate-change).

## About this site

This site is written mostly using NextJS. This is my first React project, which I learned in May 2021 to build out [Octopus Energy US](https://octopusenergy.com). There are a number of Python scripts that support it.

The source code is on [github](https://github.com/pydanny/daniel.feldroy.com).

## What about pydanny.com?

That site redirects here. The reason for that is while I'm a huge fan of the Python programming language, there are other languages that I like just as much. To be forever tied to one language felt limiting, hence why I moved the site to daniel.feldroy.com and stopped using "pydanny" so much.
