title: Need better charting for Python
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/03/need-better-charting-for-python.html)*.With the release of <a href="http://www.pyglet.org">Pyglet 1.0</a>, I'm hoping that we get better chart support in Python.  Yeah, I know that <a href="http://www.reportlab.org">ReportLab</a> does it, but I need prettier charts.<br /><br />Of course, if I were more adept at manipulating graphics, I would cook this up myself.  Thats my excuse and I'm sticking to it!
