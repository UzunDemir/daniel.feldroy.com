title: Resolutions for 2010
---

<div>Since I start my decades at zero, that means we have just 4.5 hours left in this first 10% of the 21st century.  And with just 4.5 hours left, I post my New Year's Resolutions.</div><ul><li>Sell the house, pay off the remainders of my debts, and get my own place to stay. And get a car too.</li></ul><ul><li>Travel to another country.</li></ul><ul><li>Take my son to another country.</li></ul><ul><li>Drop the waist size 2 inches and not break any bones.</li></ul><ul><li>Go to an amusement park, visit the beach, and also see a part of the USA I've never been.</li></ul><ul><li>Do more educational work for Python related technologies, and that includes getting the Django Education Foundation really rolling forwards.</li></ul><ul><li>Throw away at least half my current stuff. I don't have much stuff now, and I want even less. Also, If I don't use or interact with any one of my non-book remaining possessions by 2011, I'm throwing it away.</li></ul><ul><li>Move my blog to my own system and blog at least once a week.</li></ul><ul><li>Get a mountain bike and have reasons to use it.</li></ul><ul><li>Get back into Eskrima, focus more on BJJ, get into Capoeira.</li></ul><ul><li>Hire a maid.
