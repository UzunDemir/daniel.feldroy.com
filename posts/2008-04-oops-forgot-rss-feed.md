title: Oops... forgot RSS feed
---

Its not a big thing cause adding RSS feeds to Plone is painfully easy.  Nevertheless, it is amusing how <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/">NASA Science</a> didn't have RSS feeds listed on the front page on launch.<br /><br />I think atom feeds are also planned.
