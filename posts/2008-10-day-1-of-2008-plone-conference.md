title: Day 1 of the 2008 Plone Conference
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/10/day-1-of-2008-plone-conference.html)*.

The <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-conference-2008-dc/project-home">2008 Plone conference</a> actually started on Wednesday, and Monday and Tuesday were <a href="http://plonebootcamps.com">training days</a>.  I'll be blogging about those later.  Unlike the last conference, set in Italy, this is set here in Washington, DC.  Since I am not being a tourist, I'm doing most of my posts here in my technical blog.<br /><br />First off, Tuesday I had suffered from my periodic insomnia the night before so this day was a matter of a lot of water, light eating, and trying to keep cool in order to keep myself alert.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration</span><br /><br />I had volunteered to work the registration desk as part of my effort to contribute to the conference.  I arrived at 7 am.  Others followed shortly and soon enough plonistas began to arrive.  In no special order I got to meet or badge the following people:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org">Ian Bicking</a></li><li><a href="http://martinaspeli.net">Martin Aspelli</a></li><li><a href="http://limi.net">Alexander Limi</a></li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_M._Kuhn">Bradley Kuhn</a></li><li><a href="http://www.palladion.com/">Tres Seaver</a></li><li><a href="http://jazkarta.com">Nate Aune</a></li><li><a href="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/">John Stahl</a></li><li><a href="http://kssproject.org">Most of the KSS team</a></li></ul>   I was not alone as a volunteer for registration!  Also there was:<br /><ul><li>    Emma Campbell</li><li>    JoAnna Springsteen</li><li>    Steve?</li><li>    Paul Boos</li><li>    Amy Clark</li><li>    Matt Bowen</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keynotes</span><br /><br />I drifting a little in and out, but mostly I was focused on the registration. I figured I could just catch up on plone.tv.  Not perfectly ideal, but volunteering is good for the soul.  ;)  Then it was off to the talks!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feed the Masses by Paul Bugni</span><br /><br />This was about <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vice</span> a Plone 3.x syndication tool that lets you output types in RSS 2.0, Atom, and even RSS 1.0.  It handles recursions and enclosures and much more.  It looks like a wonderful tool for our efforts, but its not quite yet production ready.  I may spring on it.<br /><br />I like the Zope Component Architecture approach!  Awesome!<br /><br />I played timer guy for the nefarious Matt Bowen.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Theming a Plone Site from Start to Finish by Rob Porter</span><br /><br />Rob Porter of WebLion presented on material I had just taken a 2 day class on, so in retrospect I should not have gone. On the other hand, I got a few gems and perhaps getting a reinforcement on the class was good. Again I played timer guy for the nefarious Matt Bowen.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software in the Cloud Speech violates freedom by Bradley Kuhn</span><br /><br />Awesome speech!  The cloud is dangerous, because really, who own our emails and twits when we use gmail and twitter?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Usability by Ginger Butcher and Katie Cunningham</span><br /><br />I did not go but visited.  I have to say that I was impressed watching those two for just a few minutes.  They NAILED it.  They talked well, energetically, knew their material, gave good examples, and were having as much fun as two little girls in a sand box.  They did an awesome job and got kudos from Alexander Limi himself.
