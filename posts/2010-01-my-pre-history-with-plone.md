title: My pre-history with Plone
---

<div>In the late 1990s I was working at a job doing a mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxpro">Foxpro</a> development, windows system administration, and help desk. I enjoyed the Foxpro development (laugh if you will) and despised the other stuff. So I was always looking for work in other places where I could be doing pure development. However, lacking much work experience at that time, or knowledge of other programming languages, or a college degree, that made switching positions really hard.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, one day, probably in 1999, I stumbled across a job opportunity down in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia">Fredericksburg</a>. I I got an email inviting me down for an interview for <a href="http://www.zope.com/">Zope Corporation</a>, or maybe its predecessor. The job meant working with an obscure language called <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and a web based development system called <a href="http://zope2.zope.org/">Zope</a>. Python seemed pretty interesting, and doing development through the browser seemed fascinating. I even looked up some articles on <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> (this was before <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>).</div><div><br /></div><div>Alas, I did not take the job. Python seemed too different and obscure and I was already stuck in the closet with Foxpro. Fredericksburg would have involved a move from the Washington, DC area and my ex-wife and I were even then scraping the bottom of the barrel for money. We lived on the metro, lacking a vehicle between us, so just getting down to Fredericksburg was nigh impossible. So I stayed with Foxpro, eventually finding work in a few other languages before finding my current home in Python in 2005.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What might have been</b></div><div><br /></div><div>In an alternative history had I interviewed and been hired for the Python/Zope job I might have worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> during his tenure at Zope Corp! I might still be deeply entrenched with Zope and subsequently <a href="http://plone.org">Plone</a>. <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/01/learn-something-new-every-year.html">My linux skills would be much better</a>. Fredericksburg would be my home, not Arlington so I probably would not be working for NASA right now. I would have never founded <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NOVA-django">NOVA-Django</a>. Finally, the armies of Iceland would have conquered the world. </div><div><br /></div><div>A very different universe indeed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next: My history with Plone</div>
