title: Something I learned at DjangoCon

That is me in the blue shirt doing <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/6802099">Capoeira</a>! The other videos aren't as good as this one. Of course, in general I look pretty sloppy - something I will have to fix!<br /><br />I found what might be a pretty good place in DC for doing Capoeira, the aptly named <a href="http://www.capoeiradc.com">Capoeira DC</a>. I'm really thinking of getting into this, at least on Saturday afternoons.<br /><br /><a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> brought me to Capoeira. Another reason for the world to use Django!
