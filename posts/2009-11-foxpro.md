In the 1990s I was working for a small company doing a mix of help desk support, system administration, and development. I hated the help desk work, didn't like navigating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> for system administration, but liked development. Even though development was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxpro">Foxpro</a>.<br /><br />Yup, Foxpro. All of my Foxpro work was on Foxpro 2.6 for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a>. A few people in the office were working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">Visual Foxpro</a> 5 and 6, which meant a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a> style IDE and whatever object model Foxpro adopted. But I was working in the DOS shell and that seemed easier. At the time I thought a fancy IDE was better, and wasn't until around 2003 that I changed my mind on that subject.<br /><br />So anyway Foxpro was on the decrease even back in the 1990s. It took a bit of work and some luck to get out of the Foxpro closet. Fortunately I made it out. Yet I still have a soft spot for the language and too. My guess is that it is merely nostalgia for a different time in my life, and if I actually looked at Foxpro I would feel ill.<br /><br />25 more days to go!
