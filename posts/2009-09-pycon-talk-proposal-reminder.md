title: Pycon talk proposal reminder
---

If you want to present a talk at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010">Pycon 2010</a>, you've got a mere fourteen days to make a <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/proposals/">proposal</a>. Hurry up and get cracking on what you want to present before its too late. And remember, the more proposals we get the better Pycon will be!<br /><br />More importantly, if you get your proposal accepted then you earn major Python community street creditability. Recruiters will smash down your door in the middle of the night in the hopes of interviewing you. You'll be followed by groupies and a posse of yes-men (and women). And <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a> will be your friend.
