title: Capoeira at PyCon!
---

For several years I've wanted to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> event at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon US</a>. Think of it: a lively blend of martial arts, music, dance, and  nifty moves all done with and for a large crowd. Well, this year it looks like it may happen! PyCon is giving us a room and my own teacher, <a href="http://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7">Contra Mestre Xingu</a> will be in town. We would love for you to join!<br /><br />The only hindrance is before I can make this happen, I need just twenty (20) people to express interest in participating; either learn some beginner friendly moves, play in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira#Roda">Roda</a>, or just play instruments.<br /><br />We aren't going to make you do crazy tricks, in fact, anyone can do Capoeira. It doesn't matter if you've never done anything athletic, or you won the gold medal in Olympic gymnastics. Just fill out the form and we'll see you there.<br /><br /><h3><a href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira">Sign up for Capoeira at PyCon!</a></h3><br />Updates to this event will be tracked at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon Capoeira Open Space</a>
