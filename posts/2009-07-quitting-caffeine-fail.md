title: Quitting Caffeine Fail
---

In the crazy heady days of May two months ago I <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/05/quitting-caffeine.html">decided to quit consuming caffeine</a>.<br /><br />I cut out coffee, soda, and black tea. It was surprisingly easy. Hooray!<br /><br />So I happily went along drinking herbal teas like chamomile, cinnamon-orange, peach, and of course, green tea. Life was great! I was getting my anti-oxidants and none of the bad stuff. I could hang with my co-worker <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie</a> and be one of those 'cool non-caffeine drinkers'.<br /><br />So one day weeks ago I mention to Katie at some point that I was going to make some green tea and offered her some. She said she couldn't have it because of the caffeine, then she blinked.<br /><br />Which means she just figured something out.  Then she declared:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">OH MY GOD YOU HAD NO IDEA GREEN TEA HAD CAFFEINE!</span>!!<br /><br />That was followed by a bit more of mockery.<br /><br />So yeah, I failed to quit drinking caffeine then. However, today, while I'm home being sick, I'm trying to quit again. Wish me luck.
