title: Why I Work at Octopus Energy, Part 2

## The Reason I Love Working for Octopus

It's all about the climate.

99% of the scientific community will tell you that the world is undergound rapid climate change. The signs are around us, with rapidly diminishing polar caps, rising sea levels, and increased instances of dramatic weather.

For years I've felt there was nothing meaningful I could do. Yes, I recycled, composted, reduced flight travel, and found (and continue to find) other ways to lower my carbon footprint, but I'm just one person. The difference I have been making has been one amongst billions. And with the birth of my daughter in 2019, my concerns grew. I want her to have a world as beautiful as the one I had.

I wanted to do more about climate change.

I considered political activism, but I'm a realist. Governments around the world lack the long-term political will to do what's necessary to address climate change. They are too beholden to the deep wallets of the fossil fuel industry. In the US, special tax breaks and subsidies defer the costs and high expenses of the fossil fuel companies. We're essentially paying out welfare to billionaires and their employees. And even if a green-focused coalition comes to power and removed these financial incentives, what happens when they get voted out?

I wanted an option that bypassed the governments.

Then one day I realized that capitalism might be the answer.

### Capitalism as the Answer to Climate Change

For better or worse, for centuries capitalism has been a driving force for progress. The European conquest of the world was executed primarily by [trading companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trading_companies). The growth of fossil fuels in the late 19th century to today was through national and multinational companies. In the past 15 years, the rise of Facebook, Amazon, and Google was driven by capitalism. While it could be argued that none of these were healthy in progress or result, one cannot deny their success.

_What if the solution to climate change was through capitalism?_

Even if customers don't believe in climate change, they can't ignore the fact the renewable energy is just cheaper than fossil fuels. Simply put, a solar farm or windmill doesn't require constant purchases of fuel to generate electricity. No matter a person's beliefs, in general they will move toward cheaper utility costs, especially when combined with improved customer experience.

And that's where Octopus Energy comes in.

Octopus Energy taps into the same forces of capitalism as its predecessors. By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, by selling services that encourage people to reduce their carbon and general energy usage, Octopus can make a direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company means it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the fossil fuels companies.

That's why I work at Octopus Energy: Because they are giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 24+ years of professional software development to build out [Kraken, our customer focus retail energy platform](https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies). They have literally given me a chance to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids.

The way I look at it, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero.
