title: Forming a Northern Virginia Django User Group
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/forming-northern-virginia-django-user.html)*.

There is already a Django User Group in the Washington, DC area (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-district">Django District</a>). However, it looks like they meet in Silver Spring. Yuck. I live in Arlington, VA and I don't drive. I'm sure they are a nice bunch of people, but I want something more accessible.<br /><br />I <span style="font-weight: bold;">am</span> a member of the <a href="http://www.zpug.org/">Zope/Python User's Group of DC</a>, which is organized by awesome <a href="http://aclark.net/">Alex Clark</a>. It has been going on for ages. Unfortunately they meet on Tuesdays which does't work for me or <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie Cunningham</a> except maybe once a year.<br /><br />See, what I want in a user's group is one that meets on a Wednesday or maybe Thursday once a month or so in a metro-accessible place with wifi in Arlington, Virginia. <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/"></a> Katie agrees. So we are going to form what I nominally call the Northern Virginia Django User Group (shortened perhaps to Nova-DUG). We'll discuss and show off Django and the odd bit of <a href="http://python.org/">python</a> and <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">pinax</a>. We will be happy to run periodic events with Django-District, and we'll make sure not to fall in the same week as them. Should be fun for all!<br /><br />More details as we cook them up.

Glad to hear about this! I know some of the people interested in django-district had issue with the SS location too, so this will help.<br /><br />Look forward to coming down for a meetup and doing some joint events!

There's a bunch of Python/Django people at PBS, too (I work at the NewsHour). I'll pass the word around.

@richleland: I'm glad django-district is excited to work with us folks in Northern Virginia. :)<br /><br />@Chris: Yes! Please let PBS know we are forming up.
