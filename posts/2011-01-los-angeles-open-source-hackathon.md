*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/01/los-angeles-open-source-hackathon.html)*.I want to announce the launch of our new company which we've named&nbsp;<a href="http://cartwheelweb.com/">Cartwheel</a>! Besides <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> consulting, our plan is to support local Los Angeles small business, teach classes, and host events. And our first event is a <a href="http://cartwheelhackathon.eventbrite.com/">Los Angeles Open Source Hackathon</a> on February 5th! Space is limited so&nbsp;<a href="http://cartwheelhackathon.eventbrite.com/">RSVP before tickets run out!</a><br /><br /><b>Open Source Hackathon at Cartwheel</b><br /><br />A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a> (or sprint if we want to be Pythonic) is where a bunch of developers get together to push various projects forward.<br /><br />Bring your laptop and work on any open source project that you'd like, as long as it's open source. It can be an existing open source project (e.g. Django, Python) or a new one of your own. Leave the work stuff at work! <br /><br />Got an existing project? Hackathons are a great place to share ideas and perhaps find additional contributors. Let me know and I'll put it in an additional blog post.<br /><br />New to open source?  A beginning developer?

Evite didn't show up for the event. But we had a full house anyway. See http://cartwheelweb.com/weblog/2011/02/21/la-open-source-hackathon-recap/<br /><br />As for the ecosystem, you have to stand it up yourself. That is how Montreal did it and how we are doing it. Just schedule an event and get started. At first only a few people will come - but over time the group will grow.<br /><br />Good luck!
