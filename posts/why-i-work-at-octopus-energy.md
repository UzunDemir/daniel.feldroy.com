title: Why I Work at Octopus Energy
---

On November 16, 2020, I started my first day of employment at [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/). Here's why I work there.

## The Tech Stack

The entire tech stack is built on things I know. Python, Django, AWS, and modern JavaScript frameworks. It's been implemented in a very solid way, managing to be both conservative in approach yet innovative in design. While my previous experience has proven useful, I've had the chance to learn new and exciting things. Examples of things I've learned:

- Hashistack on AWS
- React & Next

Yet when I think about it, the tech stack isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find the same tech stack in a thousand other organizations.

## The People

It's always a delight to work with bright, positive-minded people who share your excitement for a job or cause. I like being around people who know things I do not, for no other reason than I can learn by osmosis. I enjoy being around them, and can't wait to meet them as the pandemic fades away.

I also am amazed by the same treatment across different groups within the organization. No group or division is looked down on, be they software engineering, customer support, marketing, or executive leadership. We're all considered humans, not resources to be expended.  

Yet when I think about it, the people aren't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find good people in a million other places.

## The Diversity

Speaking of people, Octopus Energy is a diversity minded company. In my team alone, we have people from four different continents with five different native languages. We can admittedly do better on the gender front, and are striving to do better on that front. For many reasons this is important to me, for I believe it's not only the right thing to do, it also increases a team's strength to have a broader set of viewpoints.

Yet when I think about it, the focus on diversity isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. Diversity-focused companies are not uncommon, and many have better numbers than Octopus.

## The Business

Octopus Energy is a fast growing company spreading its tentacles to new markets and nations. In the months and years to come we're going to disrupt the energy business. In the meantime, in the brief 8 months I've been with the firm the valuation has doubled up to 3 billion dollars. It's exciting to be part of something growing explosively.

Yet when I think about it, the business isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can think of other companies with this kind of explosive growth, some of whom I interviewed at when Octopus reached out to me.

## The Reason I Love Working for Octopus

It's all about the climate.

99% of the scientific community will tell you that the world is undergound rapid climate change. The signs are around us, with rapidly diminishing polar caps, rising sea levels, and increased instances of dramatic weather.

For years I've felt there was nothing meaningful I could do. Yes, I recycled, composted, reduced flight travel, and found (and continue to find) other ways to lower my carbon footprint, but I'm just one person. The difference I have been making has been one amongst billions. And with the birth of my daughter in 2019, my concerns grew. I want her to have a world as beautiful as the one I had.

I wanted to do more about climate change. 

I considered political activism, but I'm a realist. Governments around the world lack the long-term political will to do what's necessary to address climate change. They are too beholden to the deep wallets of the fossil fuel industry. In the US, special tax breaks and subsidies defer the costs and high expenses of the fossil fuel companies. We're  essentially paying out welfare to billionaires and their employees. And even if a green-focused coalition comes to power and removed these financial incentives, what happens when they get voted out?  

I wanted an option that bypassed the governments.

Then one day I realized that capitalism might be the answer.

### Capitalism as the Answer to Climate Change

For better or worse, for centuries capitalism has been a driving force for progress. The European conquest of the world was executed primarily by [trading companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trading_companies). The growth of fossil fuels in the late 19th century to today was through national and multinational companies. In the past 15 years, the rise of Facebook, Amazon, and Google was driven by capitalism. While it could be argued that none of these were healthy in progress or result, one cannot deny their success.

_What if the solution to climate change was through capitalism?_

Even if customers don't believe in climate change, they can't ignore the fact the renewable energy is just cheaper than fossil fuels. Simply put, a solar farm or windmill doesn't require constant purchases of fuel to generate electricity. No matter a person's beliefs, in general they will move toward cheaper utility costs, especially when combined with improved customer experience.

And that's where Octopus Energy comes in.

Octopus Energy taps into the same forces of capitalism as its predecessors. By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, by selling services that encourage people to reduce their carbon and general energy usage, Octopus can make a direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company means it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the fossil fuels companies.

That's why I work at Octopus Energy: Because they are giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 24+ years of professional software development to build out [Kraken, our customer focus retail energy platform](https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies). They have literally given me a chance to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids. 

The way I look at it, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero.
