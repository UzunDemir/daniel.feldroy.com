title: What's the ultimate reason for working at Octopus Energy?
description: Wherin I conclude my discussion about why I work at Octopus Energy.
---

On November 16, 2020, I started my first day of employment at [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/). A few days ago [I discussed reasons why I enjoy my work and colleagues](/posts/whats-the-best-thing-about-working-for-octopus-energy-part-1/). In this article I explain the ultimate reason I work for Octopus Energy. 

## The Ultimate Reason I Work for Octopus

It's all about this little girl.

I want to give may daughter a better planet. I her and her generation to live in the same kind of world I had. 

## Enter Octopus Energy

By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, providing services that encourage people to reduce their carbon footprint and general energy usage, Octopus is making direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company means it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the armies of lobbyists acting on behalf of the fossil fuels industry.

Octopus Energy is giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 24+ years of professional software development to build out [Kraken](https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies), our customer-focused retail energy platform. They have given me the opportunity to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids.

To put it as simply as possible, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero. How awesome is that?
