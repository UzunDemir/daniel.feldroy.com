It was my first trip across an Ocean. My first trip to Europe. In Heathrow airport I met Rocky Burt and he took the picture that became my avatar.<br /><br />Well, I want a new avatar. That means I have to do another cartwheel some place I've never been. Some place exciting. And that is where you come in.<br /><br />Basically, I'm looking for suggestions of places to go or invitations to go visit you wherever you might be. My budget isn't large, but my enthusiasm is without bounds. I love the heat so if your idea or invite is cheaper in summer time that is even better. The costs involved determine the duration of the event. Off the top of my head I'm thinking of places like:<br /><br /><ul><li>Africa<br /></li><li>Asia<br /></li><li>Brazil<br /></li><li>England</li><li>France<br /></li><li>Germany</li><li>India</li><li>Italy (even Naples again!)<br /></li><li>San Francisco</li></ul>Screw it. Lets go the whole way:<br /><ul><li>Anywhere a thousand miles away from Washington, DC.</li></ul>This becomes feasible for me after May 22.
