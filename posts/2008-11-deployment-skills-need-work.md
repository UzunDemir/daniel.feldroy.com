title: Deployment skills need work
---

I love being a developer.  I love writing code, juggling objects, doing configurations, doing database stuff, styling HTML, and implementing themes.  What I do hate is deployment.  So while I feel empowered by tools like distutils, zc.buildout, and variations therein, actually doing that sort of work is very tedious to me.  In both my dayjob and side consulting I have very good people to do that sort of thing for me so all I need to do is basic deployment work.<br /><br />However, I readily admit this is a shortcoming.  One I should work to fix.<br /><br />The good people of <a href="http://www.sixfeetup.com">Six Feet Up</a> had a <a href="http://www.sixfeetup.com/news/plone-deployment-workshop">deployment workshop</a> this month that I did not attend.  If I wanted to I might have been able to press for it as a class, but had other things on my mind.  I'm wondering if it is offered again if it makes sense to go next time.
