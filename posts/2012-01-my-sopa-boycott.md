title: My SOPA boycott
---

I'm against SOPA and PIPA.<br /><br />I believe that those bills will kill not just free speech, but also business within the USA. Innovation will wither. I'm also of the belief that those companies trying to get SOPA into place don't realize that no idea is new and if SOPA passes they'll be hammered with an increasing amount of takedowns and suits against them for anything they do. Litigation based on SOPA won't be as easily handled as the current status quo.<br /><br />I've signed the petitions, I've posted on Twitter, Facebook, and Google. That isn't enough. I have to be willing to make a sacrifice. And in this case I'm going to make the sacrifice my vote.<br /><br />My vote sacrifice is a boycott. It's directed at any politician, local or otherwise:<br /><br /><h3>My Boycott:</h3><ul><li>If you as a politician vote for SOPA/PIPA then you lose my vote. Regardless of whatever other opinions you have or party you belong to, you've lost me as a supporter.</li><li>If SOPA/PIPA passes you can get my vote back by voting for what bill that destroys SOPA/PIPA is nominated.</li><li>If SOPA/PIPA fails you can get my vote back by voting against whatever bills are resurrected to replace SOPA/PIPA.</li><li>I will ignore party boundaries. I will vote against my normal grain simply to get you removed from office.</li></ul><div><h3>Why?</h3></div><div>Like campaign finance reform, controls of freedom of speech often have unpredictable repercussions.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The terrible thing about these bills is that their supporters are bi-partisan. While it's wonderful to see political opponents working together, in this case, it's for a terrible cause.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So I'm going to cross political boundaries too. I'm going to say that as a registered Democrat I'm going to vote Republican if a Democrat candidate at any level votes for SOPA/PIP.</div><br /><div><h3>About Me</h3></div><div>I don't use pirated software. I don't read, watch, or listen to pirated content. I purchase everything legally or use open source equivalents. I make a pretty decent salary and am pretty much in the direct center of what is called the 'middle-class'.<br /><br />I'm also pro-business and a rather patriotic citizen of the United States. I believe in our nation and what it represents, and I know these bills are going to be a dagger in the heart of what our founding fathers gave us.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, as I said, I'm a Democrat willing to vote Republican, Green, Libertarian, or whatever to make my point. That's my sacrifice. My vote and role in this nation that took my family in over 100 years ago is now in the hands of politicians.<br /><br /><b>What's yours?</b></div>
