title: wxPython is fun!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/07/wxpython-is-fun.html)*.I needed to generate lots of lipsum recently.  I could use <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">elephantangelchild</a>'s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/greaterlipsum/">greaterLipsum</a> but I like fancy GUIs.  So I branched greaterLipsum and wrapped it inside a little <a href="http://wxpython.org">wxPython</a> app.  Pretty easy to do and it works great.  You can svn the results at the <a href="http://greaterlipsum.googlecode.com/svn/branches/desktopgreaterlipsum/">desktopGreaterLipsum</a> branch.<br /><br />I plan to add in new features like being able to choose the text source, making binaries for different operating systems, and other fun things.<br /><br />In the meantime, it made me remember just how much fun wxPython is in general.  I need to find excuses to work with it more.
