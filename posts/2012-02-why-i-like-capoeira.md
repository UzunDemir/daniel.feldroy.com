title: Why I like Capoeira
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-i-like-capoeira.html)*.

In June 2010 I started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> while in Lawrence, Kansas under <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Capoeira-dos-Palmares/177057772341910">Celso Wills</a>. I stopped for a few months after moving to Los Angeles in November of 2010. I picked it up again in the spring under Contra <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJfqJFKmzI">Mestre</a> <a href="http://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7">Xingu</a> and have been training under him ever since at <a href="http://valleycapoeira.com/">Valley Capoeira</a>. I go as much as possible every week, each session usually being about 2 grueling hours with the heat in the gym turned up as high as possible. Why? Because it's about:<br /><ul><li>Fun! I love doing Cartwheels!</li><li>Strength.</li><li>Endurance.</li><li>Agility.</li><li>Flexibility.</li><li>Weight control.</li><li>Personal Challenge.</li><li>Showing off.</li><li>Learning new moves I never imagined before I began.</li><li>Trying to stop being the member of my family who can't play musical instruments.</li><li>Overcoming my fears of singing in public.</li><li>Showing them whippersnappers how us old people do it.</li><li>Making new friends and joining a community.</li><li>Playing in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira#Roda">roda</a> with all my new friends. :-)</li><li>Having several hours a day where I get to just be a complete newbie and work my butt off.</li></ul><br /><h3>Capoeira at PyCon?</h3><br />Anyone up for trying or doing Capoeira at <a href="http://us.pycon.org">PyCon</a>? Let me know either here or at <a href="http://twitter.com/pydanny">@pydanny</a> and if I get enough people I'll get my Mestre to teach a session and give a demo!<br /><br /><h2>Salve!</h2>
