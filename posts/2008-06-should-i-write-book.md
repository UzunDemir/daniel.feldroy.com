title: Should I write a book?
---

I could be writing a technical booklet of sorts that might grow into a full technical text.  Maybe for Plone 3, Zope 3, Grok, or Django.  I think I would really prefer writing something for Django.  Some concerns:<br /><ul><li>Time.  Where would I find it?</li><li>Is the pay worth my effort?</li></ul>Some alleviations to my concerns:<br /><ul><li>My consulting has been going slowly.  Time could come from there.</li><li>Writing a book would get me more and better work thanks to recognition</li></ul>
