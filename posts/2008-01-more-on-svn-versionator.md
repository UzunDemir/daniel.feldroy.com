title: More on SVN Versionator
---

Mostly done.  Right now it does the copying and updates the version.txt files.  It doesn't do the Externals yet, but a coworker has argued that with Buildout we ought to go away from Externals.<br /><br />Reinout von Rees has his own version that does a couple extra bits like eggifying.  I like that very much, and may add a little more.<br /><br />Alas, work is too busy right now to finish this before our next build.  So I'm too busy to make my life easier.  Ha ha.
