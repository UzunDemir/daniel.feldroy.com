title: Code I'll reuse

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/11/code-ill-reuse.html)*.

When I'm evaluating a package to use in my work or play I tend to look at five things. I think many of my on-line colleagues look at a similar list. If its missing too many of these things then odds are I'll go somewhere else for my needs or roll my own.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Documentation</span><br />Did the author bother with a README file? How about some sphinx documentation? How complete it it? Does it get me started and give a few basic examples?<br /><br />I'm okay with typos and mistakes. These happen. But I want to see<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Licensing</span><br />Everyone has their own idea of what they like for licenses. I like the MIT/BSD thing. I can understand the attraction to LGPL and GPL although they aren't for me. What I can't stand and won't use are monstrosities like GPL/Commercial used by such libraries as ExtJs.<br /><br />Want to make money off your software? Easy... let anyone use it and charge for support. Worked damn well for communities and companies like <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a>, various <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> distributions (Redhat anyone?), etc...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eggification</span><br />Is your software constructed so that it can be installed via easy_install or pip? And yes, this is a bit of mild embarrassment for me, so I'm happy enough to eggify other people's work.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tests</span><br />Do you have tests? Even a nearly empty tests file or folder? How about a test application? If you have no tests then your package is suspect. How do I know it will work independently of your personal computer?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code Quality</span><br />Does the code smell bad? Can it be easily extended? If its innovative but the code needs work is it on a DVCS so more people can easily contribute?<br /><br />22 more posts to go!
