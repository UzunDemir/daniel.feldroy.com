title: How to sell Python panel at Pycon
---

Do you want to use&nbsp;<a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>&nbsp;but are you fighting Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>) in your organization? Does any of this sound familiar to you?<br /><ul><li>Python is just a scripting language.</li><li>Python is too new to use in real production environments.</li><li>Language X has better benchmarks doing obscure math so it is better for web development.</li><li>Python sounds great but we've already spent so much on this expensive tool that does things badly!</li></ul>A lot of people want to use Python, but their customer, management, school, government, or organization won't let them. Python is a great tool, but can be challenging to get in the door. <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/72/">This panel</a> will explore how companies and individuals have successfully introduced Python, what tools are available to sell Python, how to fight the good fight, and what pitfalls there are to avoid.<br /><br /><b>Panel Questions</b><br />For <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/72/">this event at Pycon</a>&nbsp;I've got some stock questions ready but I want the community at large to&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/mod/5uKk">suggest some more</a>.<br /><br /><b>Speakers</b><br />For this panel I choose five speakers from the broad categories of academia, government, commercial organizations, and non-profit who have had a known impact in their organizations:<br /><br /><b>Academia</b><br /><a href="http://www.mmg.msu.edu/brown.html">C.
