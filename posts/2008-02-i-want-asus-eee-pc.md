title: I want an Asus eee pc
---

I think the 4 GB version would be nice.  I would probably replace Xandros Linux with Xubuntu because then I could work with more packages.  My reasons:<br /><br /><ul><li>I need a second machine for consulting work.</li><li>It sucks when I want to go somewhere and I have to lug nearly seven pounds of hardware in my backback, not to mention power supply and various other accessories. I bicycle and when people talk about speed increases when they dump just 1 pound it makes me wonder how much easier it would be with a nice light machine.<br /></li><li>My production machines I touch now are Linux, so this means implementations are closer to the final development.</li><li>I want some hacker creds.</li></ul><br />Its gonna be a while, I'm just being hopeful.
