title: Looking for work?
---

I work for NASA doing python, plone, and django. My groups has lots of work (developing new applications and maintaining existing ones) and a need for more staff. We are looking for both hungry beginners new to python and experienced pythonistas. We would prefer to hire for local (Washington, DC) full-time positions, but we are also open to consulting from afar.<br /><br />You do need to be a U.S. citizen and willing to undergo a basic background check. Besides, that, anything goes!<br /><br />If you are interested, please contact me emailing daniel dot greenfeld dash 1 at nasa dot gov.
