title: Blog Revamp 2021 / Learning New Things
---

Today my wife Audrey and I dug in and learned some of the tools chosen by the [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com) frontend team. One of our efforts turned into redoing this blog. 

Here's my quick review of the tools we learned:

## React

React has really, really improved in the past six years.  When it first launched I tried it out and disliked it. Eventually I embraced VueJS. The tooling and docs for React have really improved, the need for tribal knowledge is gone (a similar problem existed for Django until we wrote Two Scoops of Django).

## Next JS

Next JS is lovely. I’m 100% sold now. Before I just planned to go along with the flow, but now I’m a total Next JS convert. Everything about is elegant, doing just enough to be useful but not so much that it gets in the way. 

## Vercen

Vercel is decent. I’ve used Netlify since around it's launch the beginning and can make it do amazing tricks. Plus the [Netlify's new collaborative deploy previews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/19/next-generation-deploy-previews-plus-netlify-acquires-featurepeek/) are out of this world. However, the challenge with Netlify is that its documentation of critical components such as `netlify.toml` and environment variable precedence could use improvement. On the other hand, Vercel’s documentation is top notch. While I can’t do everything in Vercel that I can do with Netlify (yet) , the docs alone justify using it. 

## Summary of Tools

It was so much fun to learn these tools, especially NextJS. They were relatively easy for us (my wife Audrey paired with me). They abstract away the nasty stuff (routing, webpack, deployment) yet give us low level access to the things we need. That makes them pleasant to use, and in my opinion enjoyment of tools is a critical feature.
