title: I want to give a class or talk at Pycon 2010
---

For <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/">Pycon 2010</a>, classes/tutorials would be pretty easy are easy to cook up. I can think of two I can do, right after each other:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> fundamentals</li><li><a href="http://pinaxproject.com">Pinax</a> fundamentals</li></ul>The first class gets you started with Django core bits and pieces. The second would show you Pinax and what things you can do with it.<br /><br />The problem is that I'm not sure what to do when it comes to talks. Current ideas:<br /><ul><li>A reprise of our upcoming Pinax tutorial at <a href="http://djangocon.org">DjangoCon</a><br /></li><li>How to suffer through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting">SOAP</a> web services using Python even though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> is so much better (I might be too bitter for this one).<br /></li><li>Why I like stupid template languages (expanding on a tangent of this <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-i-would-change-in-plone-templates.html">article</a>).</li><li>Lets move widgets into HTML templates and out of python code! Modern JavaScript libraries makes this easy!<br /></li><li>Using JQuery + Django to make 508/WAC compliant AJAX applications</li></ul>Thoughts? Suggestions?
