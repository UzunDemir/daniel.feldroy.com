title: The first effort I made in a TKD competition
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-effort-i-made-in-tkd-competition.html)*.

The final result?  I tied for second in the over 35 category.<br /><br />I had managed to catch a flu bug going into this effort, so had serious second thoughts.  If my father had not shown, I'm sure I would have just forfeited.  However, since my father was coming, I had no choice but to compete.  Therefore I'm glad he came, because it was worth the experience.<br /><br />My fellow competitors in my age group were a nice bunch of guys.  We joked about our age and encouraged each other on.  I certainly cheered when they did their forms.  I hope to see them again in the future.<br /><br />A few general things first before my form commentary: During the form my vision narrowed down amazingly.  I could not hear a thing besides my own thoughts, which were loud.<br /><br />And now the specific commentary:<br /><ul><li>I need to get my uniform pants hemmed.<br /></li><li>My deep stances were shallow.</li><li>My first two front stances had bent knees.  Brandon Winegarden fixed this but I did not!<br /></li><li>My high side kicks at the beginning had poor extension and sucked.</li><li>The high side kicks in the middle looked good, but the landing on one of them was iffy.<br /></li><li>My front kicks were good.</li><li>My hand techniques were crisp.</li><li>I leaned too far forward on the knee strikes.</li><li>The last four stances were stepped through incorrectly.  Scott Sawicki pointed this out to me 30 minues and while I thought I corrected it in the form, I obviously did not.<br /></li><li>I made a big mistake on the last hand technique and I was facing to the side.  This might have cost my first place.<br /></li><li>In general my form could have used more energy.  Watching the video I look like a robot.</li></ul><br />
