title: Hollywood Hackathon on June 18th!
---

Alas, that isn't the formal name of the event, but I'm calling it that anyway. That name just rolls off the tongue, and just seems to embody my <i>East Coast style</i> distorted vision of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ladjango/">Los Angeles</a> <a href="http://pyladies.com/">Python</a> <a href="http://socal-piggies.org/scp">community</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a day long event in Hollywood for <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> developers of all skill levels to come and code like fiends with either really smart people or nice people like me. The <a href="http://pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a> and <a href="http://socal-piggies.org/">SoCal Piggies</a> are organizing this event, and they even got some <a href="http://pyladies.com/blog/thank-you-python-software-foundation/">PSF funding for things like tables, chairs, and t-shirts</a>.<br /><br />Which reminds me, please encourage the smart women of all ages in your life to attend! We'll have mentors just for them!<br /><br />I'll be there to:<br /><ul><li>Help out as a general volunteer by setting up tables, manning registration, and answering questions.</li><li>Assist a few friends on their open source projects.</li><li>Work on the new <a href="https://github.com/LAPython/pythonla">Python LA website</a>&nbsp;(powered by <a href="http://pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about">Pyramid</a>).</li><li>Finish the <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/dango-uni-form/en/latest/">documentation</a> of <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form">django-uni-form</a> 0.8.0 if it isn't yet done.</li><li>Maybe close some <a href="https://github.com/cartwheelweb/packaginator">Packaginator</a> tickets and pull requests.</li></ul>And now to open the floor to questions...<br /><br /><b>I'm just starting with Python, should I come?</b><br /><br />Heck yeah!&nbsp;Hackathons (and sprints) are a great way to learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced developers who actually need your help.&nbsp;A lot of projects have what are called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for beginner developers to wet their teeth on.<br /><br />Things I've learned at events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other things that have made me a better coder.<br /><br /><b>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</b><br /><br />Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. There isn't a list up yet, but I'm hoping by Saturday there will be one.<br /><br /><b>What if I want to come and recruit people?</b><br /><br />Absolutely not. This is not a job fair and we don't want unnecessary distractions.<br /><br /><b>What should I bring?</b><br /><br />Your own functioning laptop with power cord.<br /><br /><b>How much does it cost and where do I register?</b><br /><br />The event will put you back a measly $15 and that covers food and drinks for the day.
