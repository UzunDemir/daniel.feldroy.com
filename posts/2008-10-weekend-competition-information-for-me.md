title: Weekend competition information for me
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/10/weekend-competition-information-for-me.html)*.

I'm posting this because a couple family members wanted to see me in a demo or competition.  Eventually we'll put the videos online (not because we think we rock, but so we can see what we did right and wrong).  I'll be doing just one event, will be up for about 3-10 minutes, and since this is my first event, I'll probably do mediocre at best.  I like to think I'm good, but I'll probably be a bit nervous and am likely to make some silly mistakes.  Of course, besides competing I'll be coaching so I'll be pretty busy and will only have so much time to be social.<br /><br />So if you want to sit on bleachers by yourself for hours starting at 9:30 am in order to see me give a go for a few minutes then here is the address:<br /><blockquote> Saturday, November 1, 2008<br /><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=4200+Connecticut+Avenue,+NW+Washington,+DC+20008&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=53.345014,73.125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;g=4200+Connecticut+Avenue,+NW+Washington,+DC+20008&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Driving Directions to the Tournament</a><br />University of the District of Columbia<br />4200 Connecticut Avenue NW<br />Physical education BLDG 47<br />Washington, DC<br /></blockquote>

Mr. Danny - We saw your form on the computer. Congratulations on 2nd place! You did awesome. Sarah really liked your kicks. Henry liked what you did for chunbee. We thought your movements were very precise and the kicks were really high. We hope you compete again soon. Thanks for posting the video!
