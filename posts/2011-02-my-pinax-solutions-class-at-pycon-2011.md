title: My Pinax Solutions class at Pycon 2011
---

Heavily inspired by <a href="http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1295120282.html">Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way</a> class I'm changing the lecture style format of the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/111/">Pinax Solutions class</a> at&nbsp;<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011">PyCon 2011</a> to a more workshop-oriented format.<br /><br />Which means that the first half of the class we (myself and the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/speaker/profile/143/">peerless</a> <a href="http://brianrosner.com/">Brian</a> <a href="https://github.com/brosner">Rosner</a>) will spend on material critical for people new to <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a>&nbsp;or old hands who want to see what 0.9 offers. That means setting things up via virtualenv and pip, Pinax specific settings, media handling, template layout, extending core Pinax apps, use of <a href="https://github.com/eldarion/idios">idios to change profiles</a>, openid/openauth, <a href="http://djangopackages.com/">Django Packages</a> to find Pinax approved stuff and more. That will be the foundation and our slides/handouts will be useful as cheat sheets for these critical parts in any <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> application.<br /><br />The second half of the&nbsp;class&nbsp;will be a workshop. We'll spend the next half helping people with their personal projects, and will even have a few stock projects we can toss at people that either already are open source or could be released as open source.&nbsp;We won't write your project for you, but we will provide advice, guidance, and some elbow grease in getting things to work.&nbsp;If someone asks for something that we think the rest of the class could benefit from, we'll show them how to do it on the projector and then everyone benefits.<br /><br />After the class, I'm free the rest of the day so I'll continue helping people even after the tutorial is officially over. Thursday (March 10th, 2011) after lunch I'll be also available to provide aid and support. &nbsp;Anyone else can join but those who attended the Pinax Solutions tutorial will get precedence.<br /><br />During the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/lists/talks/">main body of the conference</a> I'll be attending talks and giving a <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/56/">couple</a> <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/72/">myself</a>&nbsp;so my time to provide aid will likely be completely curtailed.<br /><br />I will be there at the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/sprints/">sprints</a> working on various <a href="http://github.com/djangopackages/djangopackages">Pinax</a> <a href="http://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form">and</a> <a href="http://github.com/pydanny/django-la-facebook">Django</a> <a href="http://github.com/pydanny/django-tagging-ext">projects</a>.<br /><br />If time permits we'll go over deployment, but I recommend <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/173/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss' Python/Django Deployment Workshop</a> if you want a full treatment of the subject.<br /><br />Note I: If you've already signed up for the Pinax Solutions tutorial, you should be getting an email from the PyCon tutorial staff shortly.<br /><br />Note II: If you are new to <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, I recommend that you take any of the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/108/">basic</a> <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/99/">Python</a> <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/117/">tutorials</a> at PyCon instead of this class.
