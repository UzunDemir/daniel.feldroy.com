title: I hate Mac & Cheese
---

I'm not a picky eater. I'm willing to eat every meat that is legal in the United States and wouldn't mind traveling to places where the laws are different. I have this strange desire to try pickled insects in a third world nation. I often eat things I don't like, such as eggplant.<br /><br />However, the truth is that <b>I really loathe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_&amp;_Cheese">mac &amp; cheese</a></b>. I hate cooking it, I hate eating it, I hate cleaning up after it. I've thrown away pots that have been used to cook it. I claim to be different because I despise this American staple, and silly as you may think it may be it is my preference not to have anything to do with cheesy pasta. Heck, it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_&amp;_Cheese#Health_concerns_and_controversy">ain't even healthy</a>.<br /><br />Note: I sometimes like some cheese on top of tomato based sauces or chili that has pasta mixed into it. This is <b>not the same thing</b>&nbsp;as mac &amp; cheese.<br /><br />Yet the complication I face is that I have dear friends and family who think that their<b> prize-winning homemade mac &amp; cheese made from imported unpasteurized&nbsp;cheese</b> will be something that I love. That I'll change and they'll get the chance to smugly say that it was the quality of what I've eaten that discouraged me.<br /><br />That won't happen. <br /><br />I've been forced to try everything from Kraft mac &amp; cheese to gourmet cheesy pasta prepared by chefs I otherwise respect. I've had it dumped on my plate on picnics and in fancy  restaurants. I've had the people proudly insist I try their recipe all while making it clear that they would take it as a personal insult if I didn't try it and would also take it as a personal insult if I didn't like it.<br /><br />And you know what? <br /><br />I hated it. Its vile. Its disgusting.<br /><br />Please stop insisting that I try your concoction. You aren't going to change me.
