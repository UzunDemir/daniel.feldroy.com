title: ColdFusion and deprecated code
---

Lets take a step back in time to 1999. At that point I had been doing a mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxpro">Foxpro</a> for DOS, <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, and an obscure language called WebML (don't bother looking it up, it doesn't seem to exist anymore). I admit I liked Foxpro but recognized it was a coder's dead end. Perl gave me regular expressions which I liked but I was uncomfortable with everything else. WebML was okay but it was clear that it was too obscure. Around that time I even talked to some people doing something weird with <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://zope.org/">Zope</a> in Fredericksburg, but that sounded even more obscure.<br /><br />At my job we had someone throw together a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion">ColdFusion</a> 4.51 application. They needed some help. I took a look and quickly figured out the issues, made corrections, and realized this language was really simple. One thing I noticed while pouring over the built-in documentation of the CF IDE (this was back when I used IDEs) was that there was a list of deprecated functions. You were supposed to stop using <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/cf8/#ParameterExists"><span style="font-weight: bold;">parameterExists</span></a> and use <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/cf8/#IsDefined"><span style="font-weight: bold;">isDefined</span></a> instead. I shrugged, followed the specification, and moved on.<br /><br />Years went by. I did Java and ColdFusion. Both were annoying because of spaghetti code. Java was also annoying because of boilerplate and the static typing, ColdFusion was annoying because of the tags, the weird ecmascript implementation, and the insistence of developers on using the deprecated functions.<br /><br />The most obvious example was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">parameterExists</span> vs <span style="font-weight: bold;">isDefined </span>issue. The former, paramExists accepts a variable, so you couldn't build dynamic code. Specifically you did something like <span style="font-weight: bold;">parameterExists(my_variable) </span>instead of like <span style="font-weight: bold;">isDefined("my_variable")</span>. This meant more cut-and-paste coding. Also, because it was a deprecated function, the owners of ColdFusion didn't care about the performance of the code. So instead of looping through an array of a hundred or so variables who existence you wanted to check using <span style="font-weight: bold;">isDefined</span>, people would still <span style="font-weight: bold;">@#$%ing</span> type out <span style="font-weight: bold;">parameterExists</span> a hundred times. Or more commonly, cut-and-paste from one code template to another, across applications. A good number of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">parameterExists </span>at the top of a CF page often have nothing to do with the purpose of the page and people would wonder why things ran so slow.<br /><br />Sadly, this sort of behavior still happens today in the CF community. Worse yet, because in my experience the CF community tenure is more important than anything else, the worst offenders are often the people who have been using the tool the longest.<br /><br />So lets go through a quick summary of my issues with ColdFusion and deprecation:<br /><ol><li>Deprecated language elements, even if deprecated over 5 releases, are... well... deprecated.</li><li>Deprecated language elements are likely the last to be examined in a release for performance or security reasons.</li><li>Deprecated language elements can go away.<br /></li><li>The worst offenders of using deprecated language elements tends to be those who have used the language the longest.</li></ol>
