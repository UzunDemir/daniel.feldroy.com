*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/10/have-you-signed-up-for-django-master.html)*.<a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> chief maintainer <a href="http://jacobian.com/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> is teaching a master level Django class in the Washington, DC area (actually in Springfield, VA) this October 16th.<br /><br />Jacob Kaplan-Moss is one of the chief maintainers (BDFL) of the Django project. Besides being a technical guru and good teacher, Jacob is a great guy. Approachable, funny, and taught me about anchovies.<br /><br /><a href="http://holdenweb.com/py/djangomaster/">Django Master Class</a><br /><br />Lets go over some of the hidden perks that the class description does not provide:<br /><ul><li>Even if you know Django already and have memorized the documentation you are sure to pick up some choice bits! BDFL FTW!<br /></li><li>Ask questions at any time!<br /></li><li>Provided 8 a.m. breakfast (so get there early!)<br /></li><li>Provided Lunch</li><li>Dinner afterward with lots of fun local Django/Python people including <a href="http://holdenweb.com/">Steve Holden</a></li><li>Accessible by metro, bus, and car</li><li>Lots of cheap hotels to stay at nearby so you get good sleep before and after class.</li></ul><br />I'm signed up. Are you?

Is there going to be video of this moderately priced class ($495)? I doubt it. In fact, I would be rather surprised.

Well, now that I'm actually in the DC area, I would love to go.  Problem is we're in the process of moving and we don't have the $$$ for me to enjoy such things right now. *sigh*
