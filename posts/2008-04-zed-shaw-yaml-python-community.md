title: Zed Shaw, YAML, Python Community
---

<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-09.html">Zed Shaw posts about something I found annoying</a> about a ways back when I was first exploring Python.<br /><br />Like Zed,  I too have run into the "<span style="font-style: italic;">YAML is not Python so don't use it, but wait someone else is using something YAML which is not Python so lets use that!</span>"statement in the early stages of my Python use.  Since Zed and I trade emails I should have warned him this would happen but the past few weeks have been hectic.<br /><br />So this is an official apology to Zed for not giving the warning. <br /><br />I wish I had given him the warning because that would have been awesome.  Likely he would have ignored me, gone down the same path anyway, and then I would have a handy '<span style="font-style: italic;">I told you so</span>' to hold over his head.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of those <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/07/lambdas-no-more.html">few things I don't like about Python</a> or the Python community.
