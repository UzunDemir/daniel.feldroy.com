*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/09/see-you-at-djangocon.html)*.

I'm off to the Pacific Northwest, specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> for <a href="http://djangocon.org/">DjangoCon</a>. I'll be presenting a tutorial with <a href="http://jtauber.com/">James Tauber</a> and participating in two panels. This sort of event is always a lot of work, study, and networking. I won't have much time to go sightseeing because this is a working trip, but I'm sure to squeeze in a little bit.<br /><br />Portland is a very green city, has great food, and is famous for cycling. I'm sure I can find something to do!<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who had a hand in me getting there or is holding down the fort back home. The quick list would be in alphabetical order:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://improbable.org/chris">Chris Adams</a></li><li>Corin Turner</li><li>Dave Sanchez</li><li>Jim Consalvi<br /></li><li><a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie Cunningham</a></li><li>Katie Wilcox<br /></li><li>Mom</li><li><a href="http://djangopeople.net/siudesign/">Robert Lofthouse</a></li><li>Ron Boykin</li><li>Ruth Netting </li></ul>Thanks everyone!
