title: Must use ubigraph
---

I finally spent a few minutes playing with <a href="http://www.ubietylab.net/ubigraph/index.html">Ubigraph</a>, a 3-d animating tool for generating nodes and edges graphs on the fly.  The API is straightforward xmlrpc which Python handles very well.  The result is nothing less than amazing.<br /><br />Granted the documentation needs work.  But even what exists lets you do a lot of really fun things.  I look forward to finding ways to use this amazing tool.  As I go forward it will be interesting to compare the very complete (some say cluttered) <a href="http://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> feature list with that of Ubigraph.<br /><br />Its all good though.  This makes a great companion for Graphviz.  Thats because Graphviz can generate things in many static image formats where as Ubigraph renders inside an OS window that I guess you can capture via Flash or Quicktime.  So both have their place in my world.
