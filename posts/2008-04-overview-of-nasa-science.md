title: Overview of NASA Science
---

I cooked something up for non-technical family members asking what I did for the NASA Science project.  It gets a bit technical in places, but I'm a geek so that's just too bad.<br /><br />Anyway, you can read it yourself at <a href="http://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/04/so-what-did-i-do-on-website.html">So what did I do on the website?</a><br /><br />I'm also writing something that gets more technical here.  I've got to be careful though cause <a href="http://hitss.hq.nasa.gov/it_security.htm">The Man</a> will make my life hard if I give out anything that can be construed as a security leak.  So for example, if I give out the IP address of the site, that may or may not, under various conditions, be up for consideration as a security leak.<br /><br />I kid you not.
