title: Tell me your Plone blogging tool preferences
---

I have a new internal facing Plone project here at NASA. One of my requirements is to have a blog system. So this is your chance to suggest to me your favorite blogging tool. Want to see some requirements? Sure!<br /><ul><li>Must work in Plone 3.1.x+.</li><li>Groups will have blogs.</li><li>Users will be in possibly multiple groups.<br /></li><li>Any user in a group can post a blog entry.</li><li>Output must be Section 508 compliant.</li></ul>What do I want to see in a blogging tool as a developer?<br /><ul><li>Easy to implement.</li><li>Clean code base so it will be easy to migrate to future versions of Plone.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: Thanks to the comments, for now I am going with Scrawl. It meets my formal requirements handily, and also meets my personal preferences. If the scope of the blog grows I will explore other options.
