title: Playing with Django

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/playing-with-django.html)*.

I've been playing with Django over the past few days.  I'm not going to compare it to Plone or Zope.  But I will happily compare it to Pylons.  Ready?<br /><br />Django is easier than Pylons.<br /><br />There.  That sums it up.<br /><br />Easy, intuitive, and fun.
