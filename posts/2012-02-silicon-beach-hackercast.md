Near the end of January of 2012 I was at the <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale10x/">10th Southern California Linux Exposition</a> (SCALE 10X). I gave an <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/pydanny/p/intro-to-python">Intro to Python talk</a>, helped man the awesome <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> booth, and hung out with a lot of awesome people. One of those awesome people I got to spend time with was <a href="http://www.andrewvc.com/">Andrew Cholakian</a>, a Ruby and Clojure developer, and the organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hacker-News/">LA Hacker News</a>. We've been meaning to do something together, and at the conference we decided to do a broadcast together.<br /><br />Jump forward a few weeks and Andrew came over to our place in the San Fernando Valley for a day of brainstorming, web site building, and broadcasting. We outlined a show and started to record.<br /><br /><a href="http://download.sbhackercast.com/sb-hackercast-2012-02-12-episode-1-first-podcast.mp3">Download Now!</a><br /><br /><h3>Topics of Discussion</h3><ul><li>Python at Scale 10X</li><li>New clients asking you to complete the ‘last 10%’</li><li>A rant about job titles</li><li>Why is clojure blowing up?</li></ul><br /><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="http://sbhackercast.com">Silicon Beach Hackercast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.sbhackercast.com/2012/02/12/episode-1-first-podcast.html">Silicon Beach Hackercast Episode #1</a></li><li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3584167">Hacker News Thread</a><br /></ul><h3>Art</h3><a href="http://audreymroy.com">Audrey</a> was kind enough to illustrate the event for posterity:  <img src="http://www.sbhackercast.com/images/audreyr/episode1.png" /> <h3>The Future</h3><br />The show was a lot of fun to do. We plan to do more of them, perhaps every few weeks. A better microphone is definitely in the works.
