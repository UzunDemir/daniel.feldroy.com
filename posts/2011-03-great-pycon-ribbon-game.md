title: The Great PyCon Ribbon Game!
---

Here is my challenge for attendees of <a href="http://us.pycon.org/">PyCon 2011</a> - try to win as many volunteer badge ribbons as possible. Whoever gets the most ribbons at PyCon 2011 can claim the title <b>"King of PyCon Badge Ribbons</b>" and I'll write a special blog post for you, your employer/company, and your favorite non-obscene thing.<br /><br />Rules:<br /><ul><li>You have to <b>earn</b> the badge ribbons. You have to give tutorials, make presentations, volunteer left and right, and be a great sport. Stealing ribbons is out. So is trading for them.</li><li>Only real badge ribbons are valid. You can't write your own and tape them onto your badge.</li><li>You must proudly affix the ribbons to your badge.</li><li>Cheaters will be lambasted verbally. You deserve what you get.</li></ul>In 2010 I managed to earn five (5) PyCon ribbons and only <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/speaker/profile/151/">Wesley Chun</a> beat me. Think you can beat our scores from last year? Think you can beat me this year?
