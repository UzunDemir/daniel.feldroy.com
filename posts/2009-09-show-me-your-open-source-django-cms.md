title: Show me your open source Django CMS
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/09/show-me-your-open-source-django-cms.html)*.

Want your open source CMS to be tried out by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/">SMD</a>?<br /><br />Django comes from the CMS world, and rolling your own isn't that hard. Nevertheless, we don't want to reinvent the wheel, so this is a solicitation for open source Django CMS efforts with active communities.<br /><br />Our requirements:<br /><ul><li>Must be powered by Django.</li><li>Most be open source.<br /></li><li>Follows Django/Python best practices.</li><li>Must be extensible.<br /></li><li>Elegant user interface.<br /></li><li>Renders humanely in FF, Safari, and IE 7, and 8. IE6 is a definite plus.</li><li>Section 508 compliant or at least pretty close.<br /></li><li>No patching of Django to make things work.</li><li>Must be able to run with PostgreSQL and MySQL.</li><li>Must have an active community. Which means that commits to the CMS need to have happened within the last two months.</li><li style="font-weight: bold;">You must provide a featured sites list to be even considered as an option.<br /></li></ul>Make your entries in the comments to this blog. If we pick your tool we'll give you full credit for your hard work.

http://github.com/digi604/django-cms-2.0/ but you probably knew about this one already

I've heard a lot of really good things about feincms:<br /><br />http://spinlock.ch/pub/feincms/

**Unknown said on 2009-09-16**

Well, probably not exactly all best practice, but it is work in progress (and my first site:))<br />http://www.kiind.nl (dutch)<br />code: lp:babyweb (launchpad)<br /><br />--<br />Yoram

Eric and BartTC, We can't even begin to consider feincms until someone points us at a list of feincms powered sites.

A few months ago I created <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/CMSAppsComparison" rel="nofollow">a CMS apps comparison wiki page</a> in the Django wiki for gathering information about solutions out there.<br /><br />The page might not be up-to-date since I haven't followed the development of most of the projects mentioned there. Help appreciated :)

As part of News21, a Carnegie and Knight funded project, we created django-newsroom: http://code.google.com/p/django-newsroom/source/checkout <br /><br />http://code.google.com/p/django-newsroom/source/browse/branches/pinax/INSTALL<br /><br />* We have an elegant user interface and an interesting visual editor / page layout system.<br /><br />* We've had great support along the way from the folks at LincolnLoop who have contributed to the best programming practices employed in the site.<br /><br />* this is currently in use at http://news21.com<br /><br />* we have started a user group here:<br /><br />http://groups.google.com/group/django-newsroom<br /><br />There still is some roughing out along the edges that need to happen (for instance, it currently requires PostgreSQL) but my colleagues and I will be willing to work to make this compliant.

I contacted messagecms.com for when they plan to open source their code and also a list of sample sites.

Django page CMS: http://code.google.com/p/django-page-cms/<br /><br />It's a well tested CMS (85% test coverage)

**Arek said on 2009-11-08**

So, which CMS system did you end up using ? I am curious as we are in the same step of our project planning . <br /><br />Cheers,

**pydanny said on 2009-11-09**

@Arek - Thanks for the prompt! I'll aobut it in detail this week.
