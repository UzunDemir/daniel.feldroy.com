---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/10/plone-conference-2008-starts-tomorrow.html)*.I posted my bit of melancholy about the location on my personal blog under the <a href="http://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2008">ploneconf2008</a> label.  Expect to see my more technical side here under my pydanny <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2008">ploneconf2008</a> label.  Hope that makes sense!<br /><br />What will I be doing there?  Let me see...<br /><br />First two days will be <a href="http://plonebootcamps.com/courses/conf2008-theming">Joel Burton's class on Plone Theming</a>.  Why theming?  Because our team needs more skill in it!<br /><br />I'll be volunteering to help out with the conference in the role of registration helper and general gopher.<br /><br />I'll be helping our NASA Science team present on our big project, <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/">NASA Science</a>!<br /><br />I'll be attending talks and taking notes until my fingers bleed.<br /><br />I'll be working in sprints.<br /><br />I'm not sure about my social activities.  We have a tight house budget.
