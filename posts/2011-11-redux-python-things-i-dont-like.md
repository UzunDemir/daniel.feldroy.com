title: 'Redux: Python Things I Don''t Like'
---

Back in May of 2009, I wrote about <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/05/eight-things-i-dont-like-about-python.html">Eight Things I don't like about Python</a>. It was my attempt to come up with things I don't like about my programming language of choice. Consider this my update of that post.<br /><br /><h3>1. Division sucks in Python</h3>In <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> 3 this is fixed so that <b>2 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666</b> but in Python 2.7.x you have <b>2 / 3 = 0</b>. You can fix that in Python 2.7.x with doing a <i>from __future__ import division</i> before your division call. Can anyone tell me if a version of 2.7.x will natively support <b>2 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666</b> without that import?<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Chris Neugebauer pointed out that changing division in Python 2.7.x will break backwards compatibility. However that doesn't change that I don't like it in Python 2.7.x.<br /><br /><h3><strike>2. TKinter blows</strike></h3>Honestly, it doesn't really matter to me anymore. I either use command-line scripts or things delivered to the web. Also, thanks to Brett Cannon, I know if I need to make TKinter look good, I can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ttk.html">TK Themed Widgets</a> right out of the standard library.<br /><br /><h3>3. Lambdas make it easy to obfuscate code</h3>I'm known for <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/07/lambdas-no-more.html">not liking lambdas in Python</a>. These days, I do know of use cases for Lambdas, but those are far and few between. I might even try to turn that into a blog post this month - use cases for Lambdas in Python. Fortunately for me, these days I seem to work with people who mostly agree with me on this subject.<br /><br /><h3>4. Sorting objects by attributes is annoying</h3>This is still annoying for me. As I said, "<i>... the snippet of code is trivial. Still, couldn't sorting objects by attributes or dictionaries by elements be made a bit easier? sort and sorted should have this built right in. I still have to look this up each and every time.</i>"<br /><br />I've thought of proposing something easier as a PEP. Imagine that! Me submitting a PEP!<br /><br /><h3><strike>5. Regex should be a built-in function</strike></h3>Before I got to do Python full-time I was a go-to person with regular expressions. Languages without them were weak in my opinion. Since then (2006-ish) my skills have faded somewhat in regards to regular expressions. And you know what? It hasn't been a problem. Python's string functions are fast and useful, and when I really need regular expressions, I import the library and do some research. I'm considering this one closed.<br /><br /><h3>6. Reload could be less annoying</h3>Reload only works on modules. I want to be able to something like <b>reload(my_module)</b>, <b>reload(my_class)</b>, <b>reload(my_function)</b>, or even <b>reload(my_variable)</b>:<br /><pre class="prettyprint-py">>>> from my_module import MyClass, my_function, my_variable<br />>>> mc = MyClass(my_variable)<br />>>> mc <br />5<br /># I go change something in my_module.MyClass and save the file<br />>>> reload(MyClass) # reload just MyClass<br />>>> mc = MyClass(my_variable)<br />>>> mc <br />10<br /></pre>My current fix is to use unittest as my shell as much as possible. And that is probably a good thing.<br /><br /><h3>7. Help doesn't let me skip over the '__' methods</h3>As I said way back when, "<i>Python's introspection and documentation features makes me happy. And yet when I have to scroll past __and__, __or__, and __barf__ each time I type help(myobject), I get just a tiny bit cranky. I want help to accept an optional boolean that defaults to True. If you set it to False you skip anything with double underscores.</i><br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/inky/see">See project</a> is one solution to the issue. A different approach I've used is the <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html">Sphinx autodoc</a> feature, but Sphinx is a lot of work and doesn't cover every contigency.<br /><br /><h3>8. Not enough female Pythonistas</h3>These days I know a lot of female Python developers. There is my own fiancee, <a href="http://twitter.com/audreyr">Audrey Roy</a>. Face-to-face I've met and talked to <a href="http://twitter.com/webdevgirl">Christine Cheung</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jackiekazil">Jackie Kazil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/leahculver">Leah Culver</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kjam">Katharine Jarmul</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kcunning">Katie Cunningham</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette">Barbara Shaurette</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/estherbester">Esther Nam</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sandymahalo">Sandy Strong</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/backcode">Sophia Viklund</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tiny_mouse">Jessica Stanton</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aurynn">Aurynn Shaw</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/br3nda">Brenda Wallace</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenofdoom">Jen Zajac</a>, and many more I know I'm missing. And there are even more with whom I've had in-depth online conversations.<br /><br />So why didn't I put a strike-through on this one? Because the numbers still aren't good enough. I know a lot of female Pythonistas, but how many do you know? And even if you know a decent number, what percentage of a meetup group you attend are women?<br /><br />I can say that things are improving, but they could be better - for women or minorities. Find ways to pitch in, be it <a href="http://pyladies.com/events/">PyLadies events</a>, <a href="http://pystar.org/">PyStar workshops</a>, or what have you. <br /><br />One last note on this subject, I've heard some unsubstantiated statements that the .Net world has a higher female-to-male ration then the Open Source world. Are we going to take that kind of thing sitting down?
