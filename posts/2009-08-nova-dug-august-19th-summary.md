title: NOVA-DUG August 19th summary
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/08/nova-dug-august-19th-summary.html)*.People were already there at 7:24 pm when I showed up at the Nature Conservatory lobby. They kept filtering in until 8 pm. We had another three new people show up - and all the regulars. I want to thank everyone who came, and Eric Coffman for hosting us yet again.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><ul><li>We introduced ourselves several times. How does one handle this when each person showing up is awesome and you want everyone to know each other throughout the meet up?</li><li>I did my two stock Django presentations. I need to not only touch them up and extend them, but practice them more. Thanks to the next bullet I was a bit flustered when I presented.<br /></li><li>Yup, I was star struck by the presence of <a href="http://holdenweb.com/">Steve Holden</a>.  Its funny how I can easily deal with large numbers of people but my fan boy nature screws me over when someone like a python rock star enters the room. Steve was down-to-earth though, and did an ad-hoc presentation on testing that impressed the heck out of me.</li><li>If Steve flusters me, what happens if I have to ever have to present with <a href="http://www.python.org/%7Eguido/">Guido</a> in the room?!? I am Guido's biggest fan...<br /></li><li>As a group, we talked about testing, wonders of django, pitfalls of django, virtualenv, and many other things. I think one presentation a night and more general talking might be good.</li><li><a href="http://johnnydobbins.com/">Johnny Dobbins</a> of <a href="http://www.mediageneral.com/">Media General</a> showed up. They are in the midst of converting many newspaper and media sites to Django/Pinax from various other systems. He said once they converted everything over they would be releasing some of their code as open source.</li><li>Afterwards we sat outside and had drinks. We talked the state of python in the DC community and what could be done to enhance it. More on that to come!</li></ul>What comes next:<br /><ul><li>Meet on August 30th for a Northern Virginia day of coding Pinax!<br /></li><li>Meet two weeks from today on September 2, 2009 at the Nature Conservancy.</li></ul>
