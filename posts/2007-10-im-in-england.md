Sitting in Heathrow right now.  Some notes:<br /><br />1. Heathrow is a chaotic mess.  Getting through to my terminal took about 70 minutes.  And there was nothing but airport industrial wasteland around.  I took just one picture.<br />2. The people are nice.<br />3. I don't understand English money<br />4. Crawfish + rocket sandwiches are AWESOME!<br />5. Very sleepy<br />6. Another 90 minutes till my next flight.<br />7. Working on mastering zope.formlib in Pret, a yummy sandwich place.<br /><br />I'm about to get off my rear end and get a few trinkets.  Right next to me is a trinket shop.  I will also need to find someone to a shot of me doing a cartwheel.
