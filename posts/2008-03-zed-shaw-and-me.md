---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/03/zed-shaw-and-me.html)*.I accidentally bumped into <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> while he was hanging out in the 'Python Ghetto' <a href="http://www.informit.com/">book seller</a>.  Nice guy who believes in standards.  He should have been in Python years ago.  If you don't know who he is,  just know that he is a <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">very contentious figure in the Ruby on Rails</a> community.<br /><br />In any case, I can claim that I was the guy who first steered him towards <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">zc.buildout</a>.
