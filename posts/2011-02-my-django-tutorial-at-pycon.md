title: My Django tutorial at PyCon
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/02/my-django-tutorial-at-pycon.html)*.Working on my tutorial slides for my <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011">PyCon</a> <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/111/">class/tutoria</a>l/<a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/02/my-pinax-solutions-class-at-pycon-2011.html">workshop</a> last night I suddenly came to a stark realization.<br /><br /><b>Out of dozens of slides, only 5 of them are Pinax specific.</b><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">o.O</span><br /><br />I think this is because the slides are a condensed version of what the best and brightest in the <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> community think are good practices and tools. What do I mean?<br /><ul><li><a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> on matching best practices with incredible documentation and tests.</li><li><a href="http://b-list.org/">James Bennett</a>&nbsp;on using small apps rather than monolithic ones.</li><li><a href="http://jtauber.com/">James Tauber</a> and <a href="http://brianrosner.com/">Brian Rosner</a>'s code in <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> which taught me and so many others incredible Django tricks.</li><li><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a></li><li><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a></li><li><a href="http://compoundthinking.com/blog/index.php/about/">Mark Ramm</a>&nbsp;on well, nearly everything but especially his critical commentaries on Django.</li></ul>So what does this mean?<br /><br />Well, I've been rethinking the mantra "Pinax is Django". &nbsp;It is hard to say that when users of <a href="http://django-cms.org/">django-cms </a>and <a href="http://satchmoproject.com/">satchmoproject</a> and other frameworks can't use core Pinax components. That said, users of those tools tend to rely on same foundation: Python, Django, <a href="http://virtualenv.openplans.org/">virtualenv</a>, and <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/">pip</a> and growing ecosphere of <a href="http://djangopackages.com/">Django Packages</a>.<br /><br />Which leads me to realize that with just 5 slides pertaining to Pinax material in the tutorial, the Pinax Solutions class could be renamed "<b>Django Solutions class with a bit of Pinax</b>".<br /><br />And this makes a lot of sense. Some of the bits that made Pinax special such as static media handling are now part of Django as of the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#extended-static-files-handling">forthcoming 1.3 release</a>. Lessons learned from <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form">Django Uni-Form</a> which grew out of supporting div-based forms in Pinax are helping determine the path of forms work in Django 1.4. Which means that if you are using django-cms or other <a href="http://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/cms/">CMS</a>, <a href="http://django-shop.org/">django-shop</a> or other <a href="http://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/ecommerce/">e-commerce</a> tools, then you are benefitting from what Pinax has done for the community.<br /><br />All of this leads to my closing statements about the class/workshop: The class is about Django with a little bit of Pinax tossed in. Having in the past worked with <a href="http://storymarket.com/">multiple</a> <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/">non-Pinax</a> <a href="http://cartwheelweb.com/">projects</a>, I can assure you that the solutions presented and the workshop itself will be of use to you regardless of if your project is using that framework.
