title: Apologies to Katie
---

<a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie Cunningham</a> is a good friend of mine. We met about nine years ago through a mutual acquaintance. We had a number of similar interests all tied to general geekery and kids. I've always appreciated her honesty, humor, and work ethic. In December 2006 I got her a job at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, which eventually got her involved in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">various</a> <a href="http://plone.org/">related</a><a href="http://us.pycon.org/"> communities</a>.<div><br /></div><div>One thing I like about Katie is that she likes to cook and she always does so from scratch. Her focus is on a mix of various savory dishes and baking. Since she takes care to find out her friend's allergies and preferences, it is a rare moment when people do not like what she cooks. One of my absolute favorites is a blackberry cobbler that she makes, which she does not destroy with loads of sugar. She knows that when taken in quantity sugar adversely affects me and that I also love blackberries.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm good at entrees and appetizers and sides, but baking is beyond me unless I use a pre-mix. So I really respect what Katie does.</div><div><br /></div><div>So anyway, recently on <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> when she was discussing bagels with <a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> I called her out publicly for putting icing on cheesecake. As an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi Jew</a> from family who spent generations in the New York area (although I was raised in Maryland) I'm picky about cheesecake. Legal toppings are berries, and going crazy with toppings is having those berries in a heavy glaze.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, it turns out that the illegal toppings cheesecake instance was not done by Katie, but rather her mother. Katie's mom is a wonderful lady who is also a cook whose work is worth tasting and all around wonderful person. But she puts a thin layer of sour cream icing on cheesecake. While I'm sure somewhere there is a Jewish law against illegal toppings on cheesecake, Katie's mom's defense is that she is not a Jew. And I certainly appreciate her Southern style fare.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, for what it is worth, this is my public, formal apology to Katie. She rocks and if you are smart, you'll convince her to bake for you.</div>
