title: Pylons vs Django
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/pylons-vs-django.html)*.

I like the interior workings of Pylons, I really do. But if I want to do SQL based crud apps then Django is simply stronger. That strength is what drew me to TurboGears for a bit before parts of TurboGears annoyed me. Pylons just lacks a lot of the things that I want, like built-in auth . Sure, I can roll my own, but I'm lazy. Of course, Django is really meant for the CRUD sort of thing, and I wonder how good it would be beyond that avenue.<br /><br />Note - I'll be expanding on this over time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/05/problem-with-comparing-pylons-to-django.html">My problematic comparison of Pylons vs Django</a>.
