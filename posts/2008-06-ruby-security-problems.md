On the surface:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/06/20/arbitrary-code-execution-vulnerabilities/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/06/20/arbitrary-code-execution-vulnerabilities/</a><br /><br />Digging deep:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/the_big_ruby_vulnerabilities.html">http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/the_big_ruby_vulnerabilities.html</a><br /><br />In my world, Ruby is the dark side.  Tantalizing and yet there is a rock of stability about Python that I really enjoy, even if I can't define what I mean.  Maybe its the security to know that the language is deep as it is broad?<br /><br />Anyway, at least for today I'm grateful I've stuck with Python.
