title: What happened to NOVA-DUG?
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/06/what-happened-to-nova-dug.html)*.

The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/NOVA-DUG">Northern Virginia Django Users Group</a> is still around. Really! So when are we going to hold the next session?<br /><br />June 8th.<br /><br />What happened? Why so few meetings recently?<br /><br />A number of life-changing events happened over the past few months. This month alone I went on vacation, am moving twice. Lots of other stuff that just threw a damper in the works.<br /><br />Being seeing you on July 8th.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: Thanks Chris Adams for spotting my date mistake.
