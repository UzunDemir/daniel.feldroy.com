title: NOVA-DUG April 15th summary

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/nova-dug-april-15th-summary.html)*.Forour first meeting there was seven people and several cancellations. Not bad for short notice and rain. Attendees (first name only for now - I will update if attendees contact me and request their names/jobs):<br /><ul><li>Eric (possibly providing meeting space!)<br /></li><li>Sal<br /></li><li>Jack</li><li>James</li><li>Cory</li><li><a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/">Danny</a> (me!)</li></ul>There was talk of <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> projects still under development, with one public effort exposed by Sal:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.concentrateme.com/">https://www.concentrateme.com</a> Django powered search analytics tool.</li></ul>We explained <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> to Sal. In return <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> was mentioned by Sal as a functional Django migration tool (thanks to everyone who pointed me at the right place). Corey talked about the limitations of the Django ORM compared to <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQL Alchemy</a>. I think we agreed to disagree about templates. Everyone griped about the quality of the <a href="http://www.panerabread.com/">Panera</a> coffee shop's wireless network.<br /><br />Upcoming planned events:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://euro.djangocon.org/">EuroDjangoCon</a> US-DC area sprint (May 7-8)</li><li><a href="http://djangodash.com/">Django Dash</a> get-together (May 30-31)</li></ul>We chatted about a bi-weekly schedule. We may have to do some juggling to avoid falling on the same weeks as <a href="http://www.zpug.org/">ZPUG-DC</a> or <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-district">Django District</a>.<br /><br />Future format ideas include user presentations, voting on the open source django presentation of the week, and planned attacks on user problems.
