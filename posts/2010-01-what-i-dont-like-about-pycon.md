title: What I don't like about Pycon

<div><b>1. Too many awesome events to attend them all</b></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/">Thirty incredible tutorials</a>, over a <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/talks/">hundred sessions</a>, and only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a> knows how many <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/sprints/">sprints</a>. Everything runs concurrently even with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock">GIL</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, thanks to <a href="http://dougma.com/">Doug Napoleone</a>'s great <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> work, its trivial to pick and publish which sessions you want to attend. Doug's work on the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/">scheduler</a> is just plain awesome. While just plain intuitive to use, the scheduler also has a <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/help">wonderful help page</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>2. I won't be doing enough session staff work.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Yeah, I'll be working a few sessions but I do want to at times to focus on things critical to me. So that means other people like you, dear reader, <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/helping/session_staff/">ought to pick up my slack</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>3. Only once a year per continent</b></div><div><br /></div><div>One of these years I'm going to try and hit <a href="http://www.blogger.com/us.pycon.org/">US Pycon</a>, <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPycon</a>, <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/">IndiaPycon</a>, and all the others. This would make for an awesome year. It would be like living the life of <a href="http://jtauber.com/">James Tauber</a>, <a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, or other geek traveller.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>The negativity of this post is a joke. Please don't take it seriously. I am giddy for pycon.</i></div>

Have you ever met fallenrogue?  He's the Plaid Hat guy.  He's more of a Rubyist, but basically he spends his life going from conference to conference.<br /><br />Sooner or later I'm going to kidnap him and assume his identity.  You'll know it's happened when I disappear and he suddenly becomes a lot more interested in Python.

would be more impressive on Mingus! :-) Looking forward to seeing you and taking the tutorial! And Staying for sprints per your advice.
