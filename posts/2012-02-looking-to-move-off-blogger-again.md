title: Looking to move off blogger again
---

Every once in a while I think about moving off of blogger. My favorite part about it has been the reliability of hosting from a large provider like Google. However, I'm not a fan of the changes that have been occurring in terms of UI and delivery. While I don't have to use those changes now, I worry about being forced to accomodate them in the future.<br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/audreyr">Audrey</a> launched <a href="http://audreymroy.com">her new site</a> using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and has been mostly happy. <a href="http://pydanny.github.com">I've been trying out Jekyll</a>, as I like the idea of blogging in a markup format rather than write the HTML I do here (RST-to-HTML-to-blogger is not a fun process). <br /><br />I may go for <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">Hyde</a> instead, because it's a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> based solution and I can get finicky that way. On the other hand, Jekyll, at least in terms of documentation, is much more polished at this time. This may sound childish, but figuring out the kinks is not something I want to do with a blog - I just want to write and be sure my site doesn't go down.<br /><br />All I know is that after doing so much <a href="http://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org">note taking</a> with restructured text, git, and <a href="http://readthedocs">Read the Docs</a>, doing it in almost bare HTML in Blogger is really, really tiresome. It's time for a change!
