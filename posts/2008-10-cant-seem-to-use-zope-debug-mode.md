title: Can't seem to use zope debug mode anymore.

I drop out very quickly from my Mac OS X laptop running 10.5.  Going to go home and try it on Ubuntu.  Grrr... this is a royal pain.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: This was because I had a broken version of readline on my Mac. I did sudo easy_install readline and now it works.
