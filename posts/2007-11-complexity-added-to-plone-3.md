title: Complexity added to Plone 3
---

Mikko Ohtamaa raises some <a href="http://blog.redinnovation.com/2007/11/26/could-it-be-possible-to-make-viewlets-simple-again/">good points about the problems with adding viewlets in Plone 3</a>.  It is too complex.  Design patterns are good, but they can capture your focus and make you do lots more work than you need, and not just necessarily up front.
