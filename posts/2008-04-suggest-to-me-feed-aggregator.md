title: Suggest to me a feed aggregator!
---

I need a good RSS/Atom aggregator.  I'm not having any luck.  And this is giving me issues because I can't remember everyone's blogs I like to peruse.  Any suggestions?<br /><br />Tried <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and hated it.  Updates happened haphazardly and the interface was confusing.  The one google product I can't stand.<br /><span id="formatbar_Buttons" style="display: block;"><span class="down" id="formatbar_CreateLink" style="display: block;" title="Link"></span></span><br />Tried <a href="http://www.rojo.com/">Rojo</a> and it would be great but I can't seem to easily add my own @#$% RSS feeds.  No dice - instead I have to search for everything.  WTF?<br /><br />Or should I perhaps write my own in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>?  Or a local version in <a href="http://wxpython.org">wxPython</a>?  I've worked with <a href="http://feedparser.org/">FeedParser</a> a number of times and it is an easy API.  So is <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful</a><a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"> Soup</a> for that matter.
