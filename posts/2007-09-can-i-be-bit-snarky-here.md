title: Can I be a bit snarky here?
---

So I've worked professionally with a number of different languages now.  Let me see: Foxpro, Perl, PHP, ColdFusion, Java, T-SQL, PL-SQL, Javascript, and lastly Python<br /><br />And which language is getting me sent to Italy and California?<br /><br />Python.<br /><br />Sure, I can be all geeky about how Python's dynamic typing, multi-paradigm, scaling, and low/high level capabilities makes it uber-powerful.<br /><br />But who cares.<br /><br />I'm going to be eating Pizza in Naples.<br /><br />Python wins hands down.
