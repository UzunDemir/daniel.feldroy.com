One of my <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/12/resolutions-for-2012.html">resolutions for 2012</a> is to perform an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_cartwheel">Aú sem Mão/aerial/no handed cartwheel</a>. Ideally, I would be able to do it before <a href="http://us.pycon.org">PyCon US</a>, and would perform it during the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">Capoeira Open Space</a>.<br /><br />Speaking of the Capoeira Open Space, have you <a href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira">signed up</a> yet to participate? Your skill level or athletic ability doesn't matter, just come and have fun!<br /><br /><h3>How I'm training</h3><ul><li>Losing enough weight to make jumping easier without losing strength/endurance.</li><li>Practicing a lot of Capoeira. Especially on my non-workout days</li></ul>Before you say, "do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics">plyometrics</a>!", keep in mind that Capoeira already has a lot of similar movements and I've got a tricky ankle. I've done plyometrics before and found that they caused my ankle grief. Capoeira's tight focus on smooth transitions isn't just distinctive, I think it's been good for healing what has been a problem joint for me for the past 9 years.<br /><br /><h3>How I'm doing</h3><br />I'm getting there.<br /><br />I can do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_kick">butterfly kick</a> badly, mostly because I don't arch my back enough. My hope is to get my head down further and my legs up higher. The end result is Aú sem Mão, right?<br /><br /><h3>Why am I trying to do this?</h3><br />Because I haven't done it before. And there is no time like the present. :)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="102" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fa4jnLXs1so/TniyemLkoiI/AAAAAAAAAqo/LjZqklTFBXk/s400/pycon2012.png" width="277" /></a></div>
