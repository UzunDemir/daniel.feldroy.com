title: I've got ribbons!
---

Odds are this will be my last post on blogspot. After this it should be on my personal blog.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm here at <a href="http://us.pycon.org">Pycon</a>. I presented a Pinax tutorial and tomorrow I'm presenting a talk on <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/15/">Pinax</a>. I'm also a session chair and plan to help with assembling things for registration. And what do I get out of it?<br /><br />Ribbons.<br /><br />RIBBONS!!!<br /><br />My plan is to have more ribbons than anyone else.
