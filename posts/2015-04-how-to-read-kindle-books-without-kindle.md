title: How to Read Kindle Books Without a Kindle Device
---

Like any author, as soon as I released my first fiction book on Amazon through Kindle Select, I excitedly informed everyone I knew.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many friends and family informed me that they didn't have Kindles. They asked if there was any way they could read it without a Kindle.<br /><br />Here's the deal. You don't need a Kindle to read it. All you need is the Kindle app for your smartphone or tablet, or Kindle software for your computer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lyGJbe_8tlg/VS6kp10P2MI/AAAAAAAAEz8/1-mfFBYv-lI/s1600/kindle-app-on-samsung-phone-annotated.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lyGJbe_8tlg/VS6kp10P2MI/AAAAAAAAEz8/1-mfFBYv-lI/s320/kindle-app-on-samsung-phone-annotated.png" width="480" /></a></div><br />Just click on the link below for your particular device to download the appropriate free Kindle app:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613">iPhone</a></li><li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613">iPad</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Android</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac/download">Mac OS X</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download">Windows</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=155915197084092577">Firefox Phone</a></li><li><a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/25058915/">Blackberry</a></li></ul>Or, if you have Chrome, Firefox or Safari installed, use <a href="https://read.amazon.com/">Kindle Cloud Reader</a> to read Kindle books without having to install any new software.<br /><br />Once you have a Kindle app installed, you get access to the Kindle store. Then just search for my name, and the book will come up.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />In the future I hope to release it on other platforms besides Kindle, but for now I'm locked in due to the terms of the Kindle Select Program.<br /><div><br /></div>
