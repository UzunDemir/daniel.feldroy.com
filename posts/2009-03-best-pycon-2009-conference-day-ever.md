title: Best Pycon 2009 Day Ever!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/best-pycon-2009-conference-day-ever.html)*.

Yesterday was a day I don't think I will ever be able to top again. I think it was the pinnacle of my geeky existence, and I fear that the rest of my life will be a dull effort to recapture the glory that was yesterday. Why do I think this is so?<br /><ul><li>My project, <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> SMD Spacebook got mention during <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie Cunningham</a>'s lightning talk. </li><li>I lost one of the <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> <a href="http://jacobian.org/">BFDL</a>'s dongle And everyone in the worldwide <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> <a href="http://us.pycon.org/">community</a> saw it happen live.</li><li><a href="http://www.python.org/~guido/">Guido van Rossum</a> talked about <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> in his keynote. He referred to a <a href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette/status/1403884536">twit post</a> which was <a href="http://www.djangrrl.com/">Barbara Shaurrette</a> helping me get a chance to gush at him like a screaming fan boy. So yes, Guido is aware that I exist!</li><li>NASA SMD Spacebook got multiple mentions in the <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> talk by <a href="http://jtauber.com/">James Tauber</a>.</li><li>In <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/">Ian Bicking</a>'s infamous pycon 2009 talk I managed to misspell <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey">Whiskey</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky">Whisky</a> twice! Once the Old Country way and once the New World way.</li><li>I got a 3 minute opportunity to gush like a raving fan boy to Guido before he managed to escape.</li><li><a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> kicked me in the nuts!</li></ul><span style="font-size: 180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best. Pycon. 2009. Day. Ever.</span></span><br /><br />That said, in the hopes that I can top this magnificent effort, I am calling this post the 'Best Pycon 2009 Conference Day'. My hope is that maybe I can beat it in the future. I doubt it. Sob.<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> I beat this day the next year when I met Audrey Roy.
