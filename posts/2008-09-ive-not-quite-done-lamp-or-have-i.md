title: I've not quite done LAMP, or have I?
---

It hit me just now that while I've played with all the individual bits of LAMP (<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>), I've never actually done LAMP per se.  I tend to play with <a href="http://plone.org">Plone</a>/<a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a> professionally, and in my goof off time I prefer to delve into <a href="http://wxpython.org">wxPython</a>, with my <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> work being all too rare.  I'm wondering if it might be worth it to do some formal LAMP work, and there might be available work at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> for it real soon. <br /><br />On the other hand, according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">Wikipedia entry on LAMP</a> the 'M' in LAMP can mean 'middle-ware'.  In which case I am professionally doing LAMP every work day.
