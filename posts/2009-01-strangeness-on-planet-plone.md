title: Strangeness on Planet Plone
---

I submitted that my Plone tagged blog posts be added to Planet Plone months ago. Maybe a year ago. Today it seems that I have been accepted to the blogroll.<br /><br />Unfortunately Planet Plone is slurping up all my posts in one big go, and they do not seem to be in order. My guess is that their is a synch issue between what blogspot and Planet Plone uses as the update field in RSS. Don't you just love specifications used as guidelines?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sorry about the confusion. It will be over soon.
