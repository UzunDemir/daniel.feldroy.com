title: Best DjangoCon 2009 Day Ever!

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/09/best-djangocon-2009-conference-day-ever.html)*.

This might sound a bit <a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/best-pycon-2009-conference-day-ever.html">familiar</a>, but yesterday was a day I don't think I will ever be able to top again. It was one of the pinnacles of my geeky existence, and I fear that the rest of my life will be a dull effort to recapture the glory that was yesterday. Why do I think this is so?<br /><ul><li>Fresh Oregon state blueberry pancakes for breakfast with <a href="http://jamestauber.com/">James Tauber</a>, <a href="http://oebfare.com/">Brian Rosner</a>, and <a href="http://jannisleidel.com/">Jannis Leidel</a>. If you know me well, you'll understand why the pancakes were so important.</li><li>Great keynote speech by <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/">Ian Bicking</a>.<br /></li><li>I gave my first <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> related talk in a single combined event. Me and James Tauber gave a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/pinax-tutorial-090909">Pinax Tutorial</a> that besides a demo gaff at the end went very well.</li><li>Saw a really good talk by my new <a href="http://pbs.org/">Public Broadcasting System</a> (PBS) friends! Those guys are really smart and I'm delighted they are in my home area.<br /></li><li>I participated in my first conference panel ever! We (me, <a href="http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/">Katie Cunningham</a>, <a href="http://gdub.wordpress.com/">Gary Wilson</a>, <a href="http://pbs.org/">Shawn Rider</a>, and our host <a href="http://lincolnloop.com/">Brian Luft</a>)  told our story with getting Django (and <a href="http://python.org/">python</a>) into our shops. Lots of great questions at the end.</li><li>Finding out that my 508 form project <a href="http://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form">django-uni-form</a> isn't just used by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and Pinax, but also by PBS!</li><li>Chocolate peanut butter filled cookies for afternoon snack.</li><li>Got a chance to tell <a href="http://defunkt.github.com/">Chris Wanstrath</a> not only how much I appreciated that <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> kept me from having to learn all the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> functions besides the basic ones, but also fended off the inevitable person accosting him about github performance issues (I fully recognize that scaling complex dynamic sites can be hard).<br /></li><li>The weather was amazing with a nice second trip to <a href="http://www.powells.com/">Powells</a>. We should move the conference outside.</li><li>Fondue for dinner that was so good it shut down <a href="http://jamesbennett.com/">James Bennett</a> for 2 minutes!</li><li>I witnessed my fellow <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> Dangonaut  from Ames Research Center, Mark Friedenbach <a href="http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/">(NAI</a>, <a href="http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/">NLSI</a>)  get <span style="font-weight: bold;">married</span> to his lovely fiance, Ariel Lee. Pictures to follow soon!<br /></li></ul><span style="font-size: 180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best. DjangoCon. Day. Ever.</span></span><br /><br />I'll say right now that yesterday tied my '<a href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/best-pycon-2009-conference-day-ever.html">Best Pycon 2009 Day</a>'. I'm delighted I got something just as good as that wonderful day in the same year.<br /><br />By the way, watching Mark and Ariel get married was much, much better than <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> kicking me in the nuts.
