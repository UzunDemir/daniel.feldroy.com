This is my every growing collection of places to go, things to do, and food to eat in Southern California

## Palm Springs

Lovely town with lots of art galleries/studios, mid-century modern architecture, and many interesting resturaunts. Walkable if you are staying near or on North Palm Drive.

### Getting to Palm Springs (Morongo stop)

I've only driven there, which takes you past [Morongo Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morongo_Casino,_Resort_%26_Spa), which in 1987 won a supreme court case making it the first Native American casino not regulated by its state or county. Otherwise a typical casino.

Reasons to stop:

- In-and-Out
- Affordable gasoline prices for the area
- Date shakes served at [Hadley](https://hadleyfruitorchards.com/)
