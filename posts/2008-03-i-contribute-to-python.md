*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-contribute-to-python.html)*.

I'm going to be hosting a open discussion tonight with <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel</a> and <a href="http://alltc.com/">Barry Hawkins</a>.  The topic is on selling Python to Management.
