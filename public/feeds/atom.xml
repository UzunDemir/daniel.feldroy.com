        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/why-i-work-at-octopus-energy"/>
        <updated>2021-06-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On November 16, 2020, I started my first day of employment at <a href="https://octopusenergy.com/">Octopus Energy</a>. Here's why I work there.</p>
<h2>The Tech Stack</h2>
<p>The entire tech stack is built on things I know. Python, Django, AWS, and modern JavaScript frameworks. It's been implemented in a very solid way, managing to be both conservative in approach yet innovative in design. While my previous experience has proven useful, I've had the chance to learn new and exciting things. Examples of things I've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hashistack on AWS</li>
<li>React &#x26; Next</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet when I think about it, the tech stack isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find the same tech stack in a thousand other organizations.</p>
<h2>The People</h2>
<p>It's always a delight to work with bright, positive-minded people who share your excitement for a job or cause. I like being around people who know things I do not, for no other reason than I can learn by osmosis. I enjoy being around them, and can't wait to meet them as the pandemic fades away.</p>
<p>I also am amazed by the same treatment across different groups within the organization. No group or division is looked down on, be they software engineering, customer support, marketing, or executive leadership. We're all considered humans, not resources to be expended.</p>
<p>Yet when I think about it, the people aren't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find good people in a million other places.</p>
<h2>The Diversity</h2>
<p>Speaking of people, Octopus Energy is a diversity minded company. In my team alone, we have people from four different continents with five different native languages. We can admittedly do better on the gender front, and are striving to do better on that front. For many reasons this is important to me, for I believe it's not only the right thing to do, it also increases a team's strength to have a broader set of viewpoints.</p>
<p>Yet when I think about it, the focus on diversity isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. Diversity-focused companies are not uncommon, and some have better numbers than Octopus.</p>
<h2>The Business</h2>
<p>Octopus Energy is a fast growing company spreading its tentacles to new markets and nations. In the months and years to come we're going to disrupt the energy business. In the meantime, in the brief 8 months I've been with the firm the valuation has doubled up to 3 billion dollars. It's exciting to be part of something growing explosively.</p>
<p>Yet when I think about it, the business isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can think of other companies with this kind of explosive growth, some of whom I interviewed at when Octopus reached out to me.</p>
<h2>The Reason I Love Working for Octopus</h2>
<p>It's all about the climate.</p>
<p>99% of the scientific community will tell you that the world is undergound rapid climate change. The signs are around us, with rapidly diminishing polar caps, rising sea levels, and increased instances of dramatic weather.</p>
<p>For years I've felt there was nothing meaningful I could do. Yes, I recycled, composted, reduced flight travel, and found (and continue to find) other ways to lower my carbon footprint, but I'm just one person. The difference I have been making has been one amongst billions. And with the birth of my daughter in 2019, my concerns grew. I want her to have a world as beautiful as the one I had.</p>
<p>I wanted to do more about climate change.</p>
<p>I considered political activism, but I'm a realist. Governments around the world lack the long-term political will to do what's necessary to address climate change. They are too beholden to the deep wallets of the fossil fuel industry. In the US, special tax breaks and subsidies defer the costs and high expenses of the fossil fuel companies. We're  essentially paying out welfare to billionaires and their employees. And even if a green-focused coalition comes to power and removed these financial incentives, what happens when they get voted out?</p>
<p>I wanted an option that bypassed the governments.</p>
<p>Then one day I realized that capitalism might be the answer.</p>
<h3>Capitalism as the Answer to Climate Change</h3>
<p>For better or worse, for centuries capitalism has been a driving force for progress. The European conquest of the world was executed primarily by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trading_companies">trading companies</a>. The growth of fossil fuels in the late 19th century to today was through national and multinational companies. In the past 15 years, the rise of Facebook, Amazon, and Google was driven by capitalism. While it could be argued that none of these were healthy in progress or result, one cannot deny their success.</p>
<p><em>What if the solution to climate change was through capitalism?</em></p>
<p>Even if customers don't believe in climate change, they can't ignore the fact the renewable energy is just cheaper than fossil fuels. Simply put, a solar farm or windmill doesn't require constant purchases of fuel to generate electricity. No matter a person's beliefs, in general they will move toward cheaper utility costs, especially when combined with improved customer experience.</p>
<p>And that's where Octopus Energy comes in.</p>
<p>Octopus Energy taps into the same forces of capitalism as its predecessors. By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, by selling services that encourage people to reduce their carbon and general energy usage, Octopus can make a direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company means it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the fossil fuels companies.</p>
<p>That's why I work at Octopus Energy: Because they are giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 24+ years of professional software development to build out <a href="https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies">Kraken, our customer focus retail energy platform</a>. They have literally given me a chance to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids.</p>
<p>The way I look at it, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my wife Audrey and I dug in and learned some of the tools chosen by the <a href="https://octopusenergy.com">Octopus Energy</a> frontend team. One of our efforts turned into redoing this blog.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Here's my quick review of the tools we learned</p>
<h3>React</h3>
<p>React has really, really improved in the past six years.  When it first launched I tried it out and disliked it. Eventually I embraced VueJS. The tooling and docs for React have really improved, the need for tribal knowledge is gone (a similar problem existed for Django until we wrote Two Scoops of Django).</p>
<h3>Next.js</h3>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is lovely. I’m 100% sold now. Before I just planned to go along with the flow, but now I’m a total Next JS convert. Everything about is elegant, doing just enough to be useful but not so much that it gets in the way.</p>
<h3>Vercel</h3>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is decent, certainly a lot better than pushing to S3 then bouncing cloudfront! For what it's worth, I’ve used Netlify since near it's launch and can make it do amazing tricks. Plus the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/19/next-generation-deploy-previews-plus-netlify-acquires-featurepeek/">Netlify's new collaborative deploy previews</a> are out of this world. However, the challenge with Netlify is that its documentation of critical components such as <code>netlify.toml</code> and environment variable precedence could use improvement. In comparison, <a href="https://vercel.com/docs">Vercel’s documentation is really good</a>. While I can’t do everything in Vercel that I can do with Netlify (yet) , the docs alone justify using it.</p>
<h3>Summary of Tools</h3>
<p>It was so much fun to learn these tools, especially NextJS. They were relatively easy for us (my wife Audrey paired with me). They abstract away the nasty stuff (routing, webpack, deployment) yet give us low level access to the things we need. That makes them pleasant to use, and in my opinion enjoyment of tools is a critical feature.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What about tags?</h3>
<p>A number of my books and articles link to content tags. I'll have them up later this week.</p>
<h3>What about comments?</h3>
<p>I've had Disqus on this blog for about 9 years. It's been the biggest slowdown for years, making dozens or hundreds of external calls. Also, I never liked that I didn't own the text on my own system.</p>
<p>Besides, I already get pinged enough in social media and email. I don't need another distraction.</p>
<h3>What about pydanny.com?</h3>
<p>Yeah, you might be forwarded here from that domain. The thing is, much as I love coding in Python, I've learned to enjoy other languages. Golang, modern JS, Kotlin, even C# in Unity are things I've really gotten into. By moving off the old domain I feel more free to do other things.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default VSCode doesn't include this keybinding. Here's how you add it.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I code I prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard as much as possible. For me, this keeps me more focused on the task at hand. Switching to the mouse is something try to I reserve for interacting with browsers.</p>
<p>By default <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> doesn't include the keybinding necessary to switch terminals via the keyboard. You are forced to use the mouse, which disrupts my flow.</p>
<p>Here's how you add terminal switching keybindings in VSCode:</p>
<h1>Step 1</h1>
<p>Use <code>ctrl+p</code> (<code>cmd+p</code> on the Mac) and type <code>keybindings.json</code>. Select the file from the drop downlist. This will open a file that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// Place your key bindings in this file to
// override the defaults
[]
</code></pre>
<h1>Step 2</h1>
<p>Replace the contents of <code>keybindings.json</code> with this for Windows or Linux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// Place your key bindings in this file to
// override the defaults
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+down",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusNext",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+up",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>Or this when using the Mac:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// Place your key bindings in this file to
// override the defaults
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+down",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusNext",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+up",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use the keyboard to change terminals in VS Code.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a mix of both command-line and <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, keeping both fresh in my mind. I don't want to go entirely desktop because there are times (ssh-ing for example) when I have to use the command-line.</p>
<p>Note: Anything with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) can be done with <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.</p>
<h1>Creating a new branch*</h1>
<p>Work in the smallest, most atomic feature branches possible. It's easier for people to review smaller things, meaning you will move faster.</p>

<h1>Committing all my changes*</h1>
<p>Note: Don't end commit messages with punctuation. Many projects reject it. Not sure why, it is just a thing.</p>
<p>Note 2: GitHub desktop makes adding long commits easy.</p>
<pre><code>git commit -am "I am committing everything"

<h1>Squashing all commits into a new one</h1>
<p>Rebase is fundamental to working with Git. Yet unless I really think hard I screw them up. Therefore, I tend to just squash everything down to one commit and look good in the process. Until now, no one has known I frequently copy/pasta this series for all my PRs. Here is how I do it:</p>

git reset $(git merge-base master my-new-branch)
git add -A
git commit -m "OMG I figured out everything with just one commit"
git push --force

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my recap of 2020, plus my resolutions for 2021.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Recap of 2020</h1>
<h2>I got a job saving the planet</h2>
<p>For years I've been worried about climate change. I've tried to live a mostly ecologically friendly life, and this year I dived in with making compost for the garden. However, seeing the lack of consistent political will to correct the problem has had me worried.</p>
<p>So I was delighted that when I started to look for jobs in the autumn I was contacted by several firms attempting to address the problem. I've always thought that finance is a great motivator, albeit all-too-often the results are negative (the petroleum and coal industries are examples).</p>
<p>Ultimately I went with <a href="https://octopus.energy/">Octopus Energy</a>, a company that is to borrow a phrase, disrupting the legacy power industry in areas with free-er energy markets (UK, Australia, Germany, Texas, Japan). They have embraced renewable energies as a source of power, which is good because it is cheaper than fossil fuels. Even if customers don't believe in global climate change they won't be able to ignore the fact renewables are a cheaper source of energy.</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy"><img src="/images/octologo.png" alt="Octopus Logo 2019"></a></p>
<p>In any case, I can't begin to say how wonderful it is being part of a company whose mission is to address climate change. It's like all my skills and talents are now superpowers being used to save the world.</p>
<p>If you live in the US, UK, Germany, Australia, or Japan and want to join me using our various skills and talents to help save the world, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy">here's your chance</a>. We've got lots of <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy">openings</a>, including for those who know <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy">Python and Django</a>.</p>
<h2>My daughter grew</h2>
<p>Uma grew in size and intellect. The photo below demonstrates the changes in her over just 8 months. Seeing her expand in awareness and understanding is a journey I never imagined. The challenges in raising her have been met with happiness by myself and Audrey. Her presence also drove me toward the new job at Octopus Energy I took on in the autumn.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uma-2020.png" alt="Uma growing"></p>
<h2>I learned to garden</h2>
<p>Audrey and I once again tried our hand at gardening. In the past, our efforts were stymied by travel and work. Now, being home 99.9% of the year we finally managed to garner some success besides growing flowers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bounty-2020.png" alt="Bounty for 2020"></p>
<p>I got into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost">composting</a>. The science of it is fascinating, you mix kitchen scraps and yard waste, add water, and depending on the method in anywhere from days to weeks to months you have soil that plants love.</p>
<h2>I quarantined</h2>
<p>Rather than risk me, family, and friends members, I entered quarantine until the COVID-19 pandemic was under control. It's not been easy, there are times I am restless. I've missed events, the worst of which are funerals of those who died. Nevertheless, I refused to become a statistic or cause others harm.</p>
<h2>I voted</h2>
<p>I voted on November 3rd. I believe voting should be mail-in or by the internet. I also believe the United States should get rid of gerrymandering and the electoral college.</p>
<p><strong>Popular vote all the way!</strong></p>
<h2>I wrote books</h2>
<p>More on this in a different blog post, but here's what I got out the door:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x">Two Scoops of Django 3.x</a> - Latest edition of our Two Scoops of Django series</li>
<li><a href="https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/a-wedge-of-django">A Wedge of Django</a> - Basic Django tutorial</li>
<li><a href="https://www.feldroy.com/collections/impossible-hero-books/products/necronaut">Necronaut</a> - Horror science fiction novelette</li>
</ul>
<h1>Resolutions for 2021</h1>
<h2>Be the best father I can be</h2>
<p>My daughter is part of my legacy, what will exist on this planet after I am gone. She motivates me to do my best at work and to take care of myself better so I can be stronger for her.</p>
<p>I will help her grow into the person she wants to be. That means teaching her new things, keeping her safe, and being there for her. I will treasure the time I have with her at this age and never take her presence for granted.</p>
<h2>Lose my COVID-19</h2>
<p>Yeah, I put on weight. Working to get it off. Steps I've taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating less</li>
<li>Ramping up my home exercise program</li>
<li>Working at a standing desk</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the pandemic is over I plan to restart my journey into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<h2>I will quarantine</h2>
<p>I don't need to travel to do my job. I can get by without sitting in a restaurant to eat. I can talk to family, friends, and co-workers via any number of communication methods.</p>
<p>Even after I'm vaccinated, until the pandemic is under control, I'll keep up this behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, I know some of you reading this disagree with me. You may think that I'm being too cautious. However, right now in Los Angeles huge numbers of people I know or are in my neighborhood ignored all the quarantine rules. The result is that the hospitals are overwhelmed, the staff are exhausted, and the ambulances impossible to get because they can't offload patients. Non-COVID emergency issues go untreated, meaning surviving treatable allergic reactions or heart attacks is no longer so certain.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm staying in quarantine and not doing anything stupid with me or my family's safety until things die down.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The resources I used to dramatically improve my audio.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year I started to <a href="https://twitch.tv/danielfeldroy">live stream coding efforts on Twitch</a>. Soon after, I started posting long and short excerpts of those streams on <a href="https://youtube.com/c/danielfeldroy">my YouTube channel</a>. At first my audio sucked, but it has improved over time.</p>
<p>Here's a typical poor audio example from when I first started:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0s-aMZLcmA&#x26;t=236s">Middle of the Codecast #1</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0s-aMZLcmA?start=243" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Ugh! So much background noise! My voices sounds hollow and echoes at times.</p>
<h1>My initial improvements</h1>
<p>I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used a better microphone, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100X-USB-Microphone-Podcasting-Headphones/dp/B08667PT7Y?tag=mlinar-20">ATR-2100</a> gifted to us years ago.</li>
<li>Experimenting with <a href="https://obsproject.com/wiki/Filters-Guide#audio-device-filters">Streamlabs OBS audio filters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Five days ago I recorded this, and you will be able to hear definite improvement:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpGDPOaIKx8?start=1346" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpGDPOaIKx8&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=1346">Middle of Codecast #11</a></p>
<p>Huge difference! Hooray!</p>
<h1>Upping My Audio Game</h1>
<p>Today I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Found and implemented <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/how-to-improve-mic-quality-in-streamlabs-obs-de3d16c13871">Streamlabs' guide for improving mic audio</a>.</li>
<li>I also used <a href="https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043989634-Capturing-Desktop-Audio-in-Streamlabs-OBS-for-Mac">Capturing Desktop Audio in Streamlabs OBS for Mac</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>My test recordings sound better than before. It won't block entirely block out a fan sitting next to me, but most of the house noises are completely gone.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-slug-and-id-url-design</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-slug-and-id-url-design"/>
        <updated>2020-05-20T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to combine slugs and IDs to make a a human readable unique URL design.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I like about <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a> is their URL design. It combines a slug with a hashed value representing an internal representative of some kind of index value to ensure uniqueness. You can see an example of it in my post "Autodocumenting Makefiles" featured in the URL "<a href="dev.to/feldroy/autodocumenting-makefiles-175b">https://dev.to/feldroy/autodocumenting-makefiles-175b</a>".</p>
<p>Let's break apart that URL:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>feldroy</code> is my company name.</li>
<li><code>autodocumenting-makefiles</code> is the slug and it's based off the article title.</li>
<li><code>175b</code> is a hashed value that is either stored in an indexed character field or broken down by the router into a numeric primary key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is another way of looking at their URL design:</p>
<pre><code>/&#x3C;org-or-username>/&#x3C;slugified-title>/&#x3C;hashed-id>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see how we can implement a simplified version of this technique using Django.</p>
<h1>Our Version of the URL</h1>
<p>We're going with a simpler version of the <strong>Dev.to</strong> implementation. Our implmentation will the database primary key to ensure uniqueness instead of the hashed value relied on by <strong>Dev.to</strong>.  I think <strong>Dev.to</strong> uses an identifier because it's more easily remembered and/or they feel it makes for a more attractive URL.</p>
<p>What <strong>Dev.to</strong> doesn't do is rely on it for security, as they know short hashes like this are easily broken.</p>
<pre><code>/&#x3C;username>/&#x3C;slugified-title>/&#x3C;primary-key>/
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now that we've determined our URL design, let's build it!</p>
<h2>The Model</h2>
<p>Store the data!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># articles/models.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

class Article(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=100)
    slug = models.CharField(_("Slug"),
        max_length=100,
        db_index=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # More fields...
</code></pre>
<h2>The Form</h2>
<p>Collect and validate the data!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># articles/forms.py
from django import forms

from .models import Article

class ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Article
        fields = ('title', ) # more fields
</code></pre>
<h2>The Views</h2>
<p>Now that we have the model and form, let's build the views:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># articles/views.py
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.utils import slugify
from django.views.generic import CreateView, DetailView, UpdateView

from .forms import ArticleForm
from .models import Article


class ArticleCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):

    model = Article
    form_class = ArticleForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Save the data to an article object - 
        #   this hasn't yet saved to the database.
        article = form.save(commit=False)
        article.slug = slugify(article.title)
        article.author = self.request.user
        # Save again - this time to the database
        article.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)
  

class ArticleUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Article
    form_class = ArticleForm

    def get_object(self):
        # We could return a 403 forbidden, but for content
        #   sites like dev.to or github the pattern is to return
        #   a 404.
        return get_object_or_404(Article,
            slug=self.kwargs['slug'],
            id=self.kwargs['pk'],
            author__username=self.kwargs['username'],
            author=self.request.user
        )

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Update the slug if the title has changed.
        # If you allow this you might
        #     want to set up a redirect system
        # If you don't want to figure that rediect, 
        #    just delete this method.
        article = form.save(commit=False)
        article.slug = slugify(article.title)
        article.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)        


class ArticleDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Article

    def get_object(self):
        return get_object_or_404(Article,
            slug=self.kwargs['slug'],
            id=self.kwargs['pk'],
            author__username=self.kwargs['username']
        )        
</code></pre>
<h2>The URLs</h2>
<p>Let's route this into our urls:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># articles/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from articles import views

urlpatterns = [
    path(route='/new/',
        view=views.ArticleCreateView.as_view(),
        name='create',
    ),
    path(route='/&#x3C;slug:username>/&#x3C;slug:slug>-&#x3C;int:pk>/edit/',
        view=views.ArticleUpdateView.as_view(),
        name='update',
    ), 
    path(route='/&#x3C;slug:username>/&#x3C;slug:slug>-&#x3C;int:pk>/',
        view=views.ArticleDetailView.as_view(),
        name='create',
    ),       
]
</code></pre>
<p>And in the project's root config, we add in this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># config/urls.py or wherever you stick the project's root urls.py
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # Django Admin, change this URL
    path('two-scops-of-django-is-awesome', admin.site.urls),
    # Articles management
    path('', include('articles.urls', namespace='article')),
    # More URLS here
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

# There's certainly more URLs down here
</code></pre>
<p>Add templates and there it is, a site that follows our implementation of the <strong>Dev.to</strong> URL design!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On June 11, 2019, my father, Theodore David Greenfeld, passed away at the age of 84. I spoke at his funeral three days later. It was some of the hardest words I've ever had to vocalize. I want to share what I said as well as some photos. Today would have been his 85th birthday.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Eulogy for my Father: Ted Greenfeld</h2>
<p>Throughout most of my life, I never knew one of the defining characteristics of my father, Ted Greenfeld. It wasn't until 2013 when he was 78 years old that he revealed this side to me. Dad was visiting me and Audrey in California. It was then that Dad first shared his poetry with me. I had just published my first book. I think that encouraged him to open up about his creative side.</p>
<p>Dad's poetry was abstract and different, an experiment on his part to reduce the length of sentences yet maintain the ongoing context of the work. I found out later it was an experimental phase for him.</p>
<p>As I was reading a few poems, I felt Dad's words resonate deeply in my soul. That was a surprise to me, for I had never thought my father capable of reaching out to me in this way. Not knowing this side of my father, it was a novel experience.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, I learned that poetry was nothing new to Dad. I discovered he had started writing poetry when he was fifteen. And that there was more than poetry, there were stories and novel ideas.</p>
<p>Memories from my childhood began to emerge. I remember during my growing up years my father had yellow pads describing people, places, and events I didn’t know about. I never found the same notepad twice. At the time I didn’t think much of it. I know now it was his fiction, and my finding it was an accident.</p>
<p>I don't know why he kept his stories secret, but I can guess why. As a professional author, I know how hard it is to share your raw work. What it's like to put your heart on paper only to have people tear it apart.</p>
<p>Think about the spelling, grammar, and plots of your favorite books. They seem free of mistakes. That’s because what you are reading is a finished work, polished by editors who filed away the rough edges of the raw work. For my father, who never had a professional editor, his work would have seemed ungainly when the truth is it was merely unpolished.</p>
<p>So in 2017, I published a book of poetry authored my father called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifemart-Narratives-Others-Ted-Greenfeld/dp/1521946035?tag=mlinar-20">Lifemart</a>”. I did my best to polish it. But, like my father, I am a writer, not an editor. It’s not perfect, but we did it together. It was my gift to him, one writer to another.</p>
<p>Dad was so proud of the book. I was and remain proud of his creativity. His constant drive to write. To pour his heart out into paper. Most importantly, it became the one thing that truly bound us father-to-son.</p>
<p>We are both writers.</p>
<p><em>After I said those words, I recited this poem, selected from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifemart-Narratives-Others-Ted-Greenfeld/dp/1521946035?tag=mlinar-20">Lifemart</a> by my sister, Carla Breden.</em></p>
<h2>Flying High</h2>
<p><em>By Ted Greenfeld</em></p>
<p>Beauty of life<br>
Returned <br>
When the sun <br>
Became visible again<br>
Bright light swaths <br>
Of sunlight<br>
Here, there.<br>
On the curb,<br>
The blacktop lot<br>
Cement-paved walk<br></p>
<p>Birds standing,<br>
Walking,<br>
Enjoying<br>
Hunting<br>
They always do<br>
Perching <br>
On roof peaks<br>
Surveying, <br>
Diving <br>
Down through space<br>
Feeding<br>
Little ones,<br>
Themselves,<br>
Then darting skyward again<br>
Whether sunshine,<br>
Downpour,<br>
Snowing bitter blizzard; <br>
They take wing,<br>
Stubbornly hover,<br>
Fly   <br></p>
<h2>The Moment</h2>
<p>The moment I said the last word in that poem, "Fly," without warning a great gust of wind rushed past me and into the funeral attendees. The yarmulke on my head went flying away. The carpet that had been placed onto the lawn tossed over in the air. People stumbled from the impact of the powerful gust.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was my father having one last word with us. I would like to think it was him reminding me to embrace my creativity and remember that at heart I am a writer.</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p><a href="/images/dad-water.jpg"><img src="/images/dad-water-480.jpg" alt="Dad by the water he loved so much"></a></p>
<p>My father loved the beach. I think if  employment were close to the sea, he would have moved my family to the shore. In his sixties(?) he lived on Salisbury island in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p><a href="/images/dad-business.jpg"><img src="/images/dad-business-480.jpg" alt="Dad in a business suit"></a></p>
<p>My father was a dreamer. To support the family, he bought a campground, later trading it for an ice cream store. He followed his heart. He was a restless spirit who chased after big dreams. When he grew old and didn't have the energy to run around, his creativity flowed out even more through his pen on paper, through drawings and writing.</p>
<!-- 
My father often worked for himself. When he worked for others he would start a new job with excitement but as the months passed he would grow frustrated with it. Most of my life I thought he was just argumentative at work.

Now I believe he just wanted to write. -->

<p>This was taken in 2010, the last time I visited my father when he lived in Washington, DC. He was giving me advice about my big move across the USA to California to be with Audrey.</p>

        <updated>2020-02-28T04:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to use Python to combine PDFs and then add metadata to them.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For both <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/django-crash-course">Django Crash Course</a> and the forthcoming Two Scoops of Django 3.x, we're using a new process to render the PDFs. Unfortunately, until just a few days ago that process didn't include the cover. Instead, covers were inserted manually using Adobe Acrobat.</p>
<p>While that manual process worked, <a href="https://github.com/roygreenfeld/django-crash-course/issues/132">it came with predictable consequences</a>.</p>
<h2>Merging the PDFs</h2>
<p>This part was easy and found in any number of blog articles and Stack Overflow answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/">pypdf2</a></li>
<li>Step 2: Write a script as seen below</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

now = datetime.now()

pdfs = [
  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',
  '_output/dcc.pdf',
]

merger = PdfFileMerger()

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

merger.write("releases/beta-20200226.pdf")
merger.close()    
</code></pre>
<p>It was at this point that we discovered that our new file, <code>releases/beta-20200226.pdf</code>, was missing most of the metadata. Oh no!</p>
<h2>Adding the Metadata</h2>
<p>According to the PyPDF2 docs, <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/PdfFileMerger.html#PyPDF2.PdfFileMerger.addMetadata">adding metadata is very straight-forward</a>. Just pass a <code>dict</code> into the <code>addMetadata()</code> function. I inserted this code right before the call to <code>merger.write()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">merger.addMetadata({
    "Title": "Django Crash Course",  
    "Authors": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',
    "Description": "Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x",
    "ContentCreator": "Two Scoops Press",
    "CreateDate": "2020-02-26",
    "ModifyDate": "2020-02-26",
})
</code></pre>
<p>The PDF built! Yeah! Time to open it up and see the results!</p>
<p>Alas, no metadata showed up.</p>
<p>Then I spent a long time with trial-and-error trying to get the metadata to show up properly. While there are lots of Python-related articles on <strong>extracting</strong> metadata using PyPDF2, I struggled to find anything that explained how to add metadata.</p>
<h2>Doing My Homework</h2>
<p>After a bunch of research (googling, stack overlow-ing, and visiting forums) I found a wonderful book on O'Reilly called <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/">PDF Explained</a> by John Whitington. Much credit to John Whitington, he's a good writer and very knowledgable on the topic of PDF.</p>
<p>For my purposes, the two critical sections were found in Chapter 4 of PDF Explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries</li>
<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#dates</li>
</ul>
<p>Based off what I read, I established the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every metadata field name had to be prefixed with <code>/</code></li>
<li>Stick to the metadata names found in chapter 4</li>
<li>Follow the date format supplied in chapter 4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing the Code!</h2>
<p>Now armed with my rules I returned to the code. This is what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

pdfs = [
  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',
  '_output/dcc.pdf',
]

merger = PdfFileMerger()

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

# Make PDF datestamp
now = datetime.now()
pdf_datestamp = now.strftime("D:%Y%m%d%H%M%S-8'00'")

# https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries
# Fields are **precisely** named
merger.addMetadata({
    "/Author": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',
    "/Title": "Django Crash Course",
    "/Subject": "Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x",
    "/Creator": "Two Scoops Press",
    "/CreationDate": pdf_datestamp,
    "/ModDate": pdf_datestamp,
})

# Write the release
version = f"beta-{now.strftime('%Y%m%d')}"
merger.write(f"releases/{version}.pdf")
merger.close()
</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The lesson I learned writing this little utility is that as useful as Google and Stack Overflow might be, sometimes you need to explore reference manuals. Which, if you ask me, is a lot of fun. :-)</p>
<p>Speaking of reference manuals, while I referenced the online version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006H4DAE6/?tag=mlinar-20">PDF Explained</a> to get my work done, I've ordered a kindle version of the book. It's the least I can do.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We wrote a beginner-friendly tutorial book for Django!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Audrey and I wrote a new book titled <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course">Django Crash Course</a>. You can get it right now on our website at <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course">roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course</a>. Right now it's in <strong>alpha</strong>, which means only the e-book is available. Later we'll produce it in print formats (perfect bound, spiral, and hardcover).</p>
<p>As the book is in alpha, you're encouraged to submit bug reports to us for errors that you find. In turn we will give you credit for your contributions in not just the e-book, but also in the print paperback and online publicly on the web. This is your opportunity to have your name in one of our books as a contributor, which you are then welcome to add to your resume and LinkedIn profile. We followed the same pattern with our Two Scoops of Django books.</p>
<h2>Check it out!</h2>
<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course"><img src="https://daniel.roygreenfeld.com/images/Django_Crash_Course_3_E-Book_Download_740x.jpg" alt="Cover for Django Crash Course"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course">Django Crash Course</a> is designed to build solid foundations for any developer looking to get quickly and solidly proficient with Django 3. Once you've finished the book, you'll be able to purchase Django Crash Course extensions on topics such as deployment on various platforms, Django REST Framework (DRF), Javascript frameworks like VueJS and/or React, third-party packages, and more.</p>
<h2>Some of My Favorite Features</h2>
<h3>Friendly to Data Scientists</h3>
<p>We chose <strong>Conda</strong> as our Python environment and <strong>pip</strong> for dependency management. This makes getting everything right across different operating systems for students very straightforward.  These tools also empower us to create data-focused extensions to the core book.</p>
<h3>Class-Based Views</h3>
<p>Our opinion is that beginners should be taught Class-Based Views (CBVs) from the start. Knowing CBVs from the start makes understanding critical CBV-based packages like <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> much easier. We also believe that the explicit nature of the <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, and other HTTP methods is easier for beginners to grasp. Years of success at levelling up people with Django supports our opinion.</p>
<h3>Theme!</h3>
<p>Tutorial themes are cheesy. That's why we use cheese as the theme for the main project in the book!</p>
<p><em>We also want to be the most successful dairy-themed tech book authors in the universe.</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you'd like to buy the book (or learn more about it), do so on the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course">The Django Crash Course page on roygreenfeld.com</a>.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing a Python script to generate my blog feed]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late last year I <a href="/moving-to-vuepress.html">changed my blog engine yet again</a>. I've been happy with it so far, with the exception of XML feeds. The tooling I chose doesn't have good support for feeds, certainly not with the filtering I need. Specifically, I need to have a <code>python</code> feed, a <code>family</code> feed, and so on. As much as I love my <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">wife</a> and <a href="/recap-2019-resolutions-2020.html#my-daughter-was-born">daughter</a>, non-technical posts about them probably don't belong on places where this post will show up.</p>
<p>After trying to work within the framework of the blog engine (Vuepress), I got tired of fighting abstraction and gave up. My blog wouldn't have an XML feed.</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Last night I decided to go around the problem. In 30 minutes I coded up a solution, a Python script that bypasses the Vuepress abstraction. You can see it below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">"""
generate_feed.py

Usage:

    python generate_feed.py TAGHERE

Note:

    Works with Python 3.8, untested otherwise.

    from feedgen.feed import FeedGenerator
    from yaml import safe_load
    from markdown2 import Markdown
except ImportError:
    print("You need to install pyyaml, feedgen, and markdown2")
    sys.exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":

    try:
        tag = sys.argv[1]
    except IndexError:
        print('Add a tag argument such as "python"')
        sys.exit(1)

    # TODO - convert to argument
    YEARS = [
        "2020",
    ]

    markdowner = Markdown(extras=["fenced-code-blocks", ])

    fg = FeedGenerator()
    fg.id("https://daniel.roygreenfeld.com/")
    fg.title("pydanny")
    fg.author(

        }
    )
    fg.link(href="https://daniel.roygreenfeld.com", rel="alternate")

    fg.language("en")

    years = [f"_posts/posts{x}/*.md" for x in YEARS]
    years.sort()
    years.reverse()

    def read_post(filename):
        with open(filename) as f:
            raw = f.read()[3:]

        config = safe_load(raw[: raw.index("---")])
        content = raw[raw.index("---") + 3 :]

        return config, content

    feed = []

    for year in years:
        posts = glob(year)
        posts.sort()
        posts.reverse()
        for post in posts:
            config, content = read_post(post)
            if tag not in config["tags"]:
                continue

            # add the metadata
            print(config["title"])
            entry = fg.add_entry()
            entry.id(f'https://daniel.roygreenfeld.com/{config["slug"]}.html')
            entry.title(config["title"])
            entry.description(config["description"])
            entry.pubDate(config["date"])

            # Add the content

    print(fg.atom_str(pretty=True))
    fg.atom_file(f".vuepress/public/feeds/{tag}.atom.xml")

</code></pre>
<p>You call this on my blog for all <code>python</code> tagged content by running it thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python generate_feed.py python
</code></pre>
<p>The result <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/#validate_by_input">validates per W3C</a> and should work everywhere. Yeah!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is what I've always enjoyed about Python. In a very short time I can throw together a script that makes my life better.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Recap of 2019</h2>
<h3>My Daughter Was Born</h3>
<p>In January of this year <strong>Uma Roy Greenfeld</strong> came into this world at 8 lbs 5 oz (3770 grams). Words cannot express the sublime joy I feel watching her grow and learn. The changes and disruption to my life has been outmatched by just how rich my existence has become.</p>
<p>Being a parent of a newborn has changed my thinking. It's driving some of the plans I share with Audrey Roy Greenfeld for 2020 and beyond. More on that will be posted with the new year.</p>

<p><em>Click the image above to see more photos from my daughter's first year.</em></p>
<h3>My Father Passed Away</h3>
<p>Theodore "Ted" Greenfeld passed away in June at age 84. I learned a lot of life lessons from him - there's so much to say. Soon I'll post the eulogy I wrote for him, and publish his writings. Below is a photo of him by the Chesapeake Bay in the 1980s. He loved the water, especially the beach.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ted-greenfeld-1980s.jpg" alt="Ted Greenfeld circa 1980s at the Chesapeake Bay"></p>
<h3>I Travelled</h3>
<h4>Ghana, Africa</h4>
<p>I went to Africa for the first time! I was there to attend the very first <a href="https://africa.pycon.org/">PyCon Africa</a> in Accra, Ghana. What a wonderful experience - I enjoyed the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5EMKJc8AzyrvG8vy7">people, sights, and food</a>. Click the image below to see my photo journal.</p>
<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5EMKJc8AzyrvG8vy7"><img src="/images/ghana_architecture.jpg" alt="Lovely building in Accra, Ghana"></a></p>
<h4>New Zealand</h4>
<p>I returned to Wellington, New Zealand to give a keynote at <a href="https://python.nz/">Kiwi PyCon 2019</a>. Audrey gave a keynote there in 2011, which means if we follow the pattern my daughter Uma will give a keynote there in 2027. In any case, it was so much fun reconnecting with old friends and making new ones.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pycon-nz-2019.jpg" alt="Kiwi PyCon family photo!"></p>
<h4>Kolkata, India</h4>
<p>I went to India for the first time! This was a family visit for the holiday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja">Durga Puja</a>. Uma was a special guest everywhere on account of her name, which is one of the names of the goddess Durga. It was a delight to be connected to the Hindu portion of her Bengali ancestry.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pandal-2019.jpg" alt="Pandal - a temporary shrine made of cloth, wood, and rope, built for the holiday"></p>
<h4>Yucutan, Mexico</h4>
<p>Since it's so close to me, we've gone to Mexico every year since 2010 and 2019 was no different. This time it was to the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula to visit Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum. We even took the time to visit <a href="./meeting-python-devs-in-cancun">PyCun, the Cancun Python group</a>.</p>
<h4>USA</h4>
<p>Within the USA I visited upstate New Jersey, New York City, and Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<h3>I Ate Coconut</h3>
<p>For most of my life I've been allergic to coconut. In the past few years eating coconut has been less of an issue for me. As of my trip to Ghana in August of 2019 the allergy is gone. I'm excited, this opens up a whole new world of food possibilities.</p>
<h3>I Like Static Typing</h3>
<p>In 2004-2005 I nearly stopped being a programmer due to frustrations with J2EE-style Java and static typing. Nothing against Java, it just wasn't for me. Python was Introduced to me at NASA in the summer of 2005 and kept me in my chosen career, in large part due to its typing. While I dallied in Golang six years ago, the typing made me unhappy.</p>
<p>Well, in late 2019 I participated in hackathons using both <a href="./thoughts-on-kotlin">Kotlin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>. To my surprise I had tons of fun. The C# is especially empowering to me, as it means I can write games and apps with the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3d platform</a>.</p>
<h3>Embraced Fitness Again</h3>
<p>For a number of years I haven't been consistent with staying in shape. My weight went up and a lot of my clothes stopped fitting. Of greater concern is I want to be a strong, fit role model for my daughter. So in late 2019 I really jumped back into fitness, starting a mix of Yoga and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). The Yoga helps with some nagging injuries and the BJJ allows me to express my competitive nature in a healthy way. If I visit your area or <a href="https://xlvcbmartialarts.com/">you visit mine</a>, let's roll as friendly competitors.</p>
<p>Yes, my clothes are fitting again.</p>

<h2>Resolutions for 2020</h2>
<p>I know everyone doesn't do this kind of thing, but I always do.</p>
<h3>Travel to New Places</h3>
<p>It's been years since I've been anywhere new within my own homeland of the USA. Time to see something new. My dream would be to do it in an solar-powered electric vehicle or comfortable public transit, but anything will do.</p>
<h3>Stay on Track for Fitness</h3>
<p>Inspired by being a new father, I'm going to continue this trend. Each week I'll put in at least 5 hours of vigorous exercise a week spread betweem BJJ, yoga, cycling, and other activities.</p>
<h3>Write More Books</h3>
<p>Starting this month I plan to release both fiction and non-fiction works. Stay tuned here or on the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/blogs/news">roygreenfeld.com blog</a>!</p>
<h3>Make Video Games</h3>
<p>I first got into programming to make games. Having rediscovered the fun of making games, it's only fitting that I return to those roots. Leveraging the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3d platform</a> means I can create games that friends and family can enjoy.</p>
<h3>Get Over My Fear of Heights</h3>
<p>A limiting factor for me has been that I'm scared of being more than 10 feet off the ground. I can handle it in buildings and planes, but the fear is still there. And everything else terrifies me. While this may be a good survival instinct, it's meant lost opportunities on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>What I don't want to do is pass on that fear to my daughter. A healthy respect of danger is one thing, abject fear is not.</p>
<p>To combat this fear in 2019 <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rE6wPe5PAboFBEsf6">I walked on transparent flooring</a>, climb ladders, and stand closer to railings. I even used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-All-Gaming-Headset-android/dp/B07PRDGYTW?tag=mlinar-20">VR devices</a> to help myself combat this fear.</p>
<p>In 2020 I'm going to go further. I'm going to take up rock climbing and find other ways to push myself.</p>
<h3>Improve the World</h3>
<p>If you think this last resolution was inspired by Uma, you would be correct. I want to improve the world for her and the future generations who share this planet with her.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My notes and impressions about this Android-friendly JVM language.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend Audrey and I competed in the Los Angeles edition of the <a href="https://www.techtoprotectchallenge.org/">Tech to Protect Challenge</a> hackathon. It was fun, we came up with ideas to increase people's safety, talked to first responders, and learned how to build Android apps with <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>. We won in our <a href="https://www.techtoprotectchallenge.org/contest/contest-005/">category</a>, but that's a blog post for another day.</p>
<p>This blog post contains my notes on <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>.</p>
<h1>Variable Declaration</h1>
<p>Kotlin has two variable types, mutable and immutable. You distinguish between them by defining them with <code>val</code> for immutable and <code>var</code> for mutable. You can specify type, but Kotlin can infer type based on how you declare it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// immutables
val a = "I am an immutable string"
val b:String = "I am an immutable string with an explicit declared type of String"

// mutables
var c = "I am a mutable string"
var d:String = "I am an string with an explicit declared type of String"
</code></pre>
<h1>Char vs String / Single Quotes vs Double Quotes</h1>
<p>This caught me completely off-guard. Especially as I prefer using single quotes. It's one less key to press on the US keyboard.</p>
<p>You see, unlike Python and Javascript, Kotlin differentiates between <code>Char</code> and <code>String</code> types. In simplest terms, a <code>Char</code> must have a single character and is surrounded by single quotes and <code>String</code> has zero to many characters and is surrounded by double quotes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Char example, throws an error if variable has more than 1 character
val singleLetterVariable:Char = 'a'

// String examples
val emptyString:String = ""
val singleLetterVariable2:String = "b"
val manyLettersVariable:String = "Learning is fun"
</code></pre>
<h1>When Instead of Switch/Case</h1>
<p><a href="/why-doesnt-python-have-switch-case.html">Python doesn't have a switch or case statement</a>, and neither does Kotlin. Instead it has a <code>when</code> keyword that very much shortens the dialogue necessary for branch control. Rather than using this traditional switch/case style code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function numberToString(argument) {
  switch (argument) {
    case 0:
      return "zero";
    case 1:
      return "one";
    case 2:
      return "two";
    default:
      return "nothing";
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Kotlin you describe it thus with <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#when-expression">when</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun numberToString(number: Int): String {
 when(number) {
   0 -> return "zero"
   1 -> return "one"
   2 -> return "two"
   else -> return "nothing"
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This syntax is is concise and powerful. In fact, there's a lot of <a href="https://superkotlin.com/kotlin-when-statement/">syntactical sugar</a> I'm not covering.</p>
<h1>General Control Flow</h1>
<p>There's a lot of similarity with other languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>if/else/else if</code> keywords.</li>
<li><code>for</code> loops</li>
<li><code>while</code></li>
<li><code>do while</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Data Classes</h1>
<p>Just as Python has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">Dataclasses</a>, Kotlin comes with a similar, more constrained <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html">Data Class</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">>>> // Define the data class
>>> data class Baby(val name: String, val age: Int, val ageType: String)
>>> // Instantiate and display the result
>>> val daughter = Baby(name="Uma", age=10, ageType="months")
>>> println(daughter.name)
Uma
</code></pre>
<h1>MutableMaps as Python/Javascript-Style Key/Value Structures</h1>
<p>One thing I dislike about Java is while there are many ways to do key/value structures, none of them fit my brain like Python dictionaries or Javascript objects. Mutable maps are the closest thing to what I prefer, and Kotlin has it as a stdlib function called <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/mutable-map-of.html">mutableMapOf</a> to support it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">>>> val daughter = mutableMapOf("name" to "Uma", "age" to 10, "ageType" to "months")
>>> println(daughter["name"])
Uma
</code></pre>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>What I like about Kotlin is that it follows pretty standard syntactic patterns, there's no wheels being reinvented. Even the <a href="#when-instead-of-switch-case">when</a> statement is pretty straightforward. While there's quirks such as the use of <a href="#char-vs-string-single-quotes-vs-double-quotes">single quotes with the Char type</a>, nothing makes me want to bang my head against the wall. Instead, I was productive in minutes upon first looking at the language.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring that code in my articles actually works.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've always wanted to run tests on my code snippets in markdown files. Here's how I implemented it on a lazy sunday.</p>
<h1>A Little Bit of History</h1>
<p>If you look back at some of the older articles on my blog you'll see I used <a href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a> assertions to verify that code I wrote actually worked if you tried it out. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cached-property.html">cached-property: Don't copy/paste code</a></li>
<li><a href="/docstrings-and-various-python-objects.html">Docstrings and Various Python Objects</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a little Python script that would recursively search my blog for <code>ReStructuredText</code>, slurp out the Python blocks, write those to file, then run pytest against the generated files. This meant that while my blog might have grammar or spelling errors, the code was bug-free. Having moved to <code>Markdown</code>, this script is no longer valid.</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>With the advent of my new blog I decided to rewrite the testrunner script with these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works with individual Markdown files. For debugging of blog entries this is faster and easier.</li>
<li>Rely on simple Python <code>assert</code> statements. Nothing against pytest, but if I'm testing individual files, it's overkill.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>Let's say I have a code snippet with two asserts spread out over two code blocks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def times_5(x):
    return x * 5

assert times_5(3) == 15
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">assert times_5(4) == 20
</code></pre>
<p>When I run it, the script slurps these code blocks up and combines them into a single Python file called <code>testfile.py</code>. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def times_5(x):
    return x * 5

assert times_5(3) == 15
assert times_5(4) == 20
</code></pre>
<p>Once saved as <code>testfile.py</code>, then <code>subprocess.Popen()</code> runs the code and captures the results. Any errors are reported to the user. If you change it to <code>assert times_5(4) == 200</code>, it's going to throw an <code>AssertionError</code> because 5 times 4 isn't 200.</p>
<h1>The Code</h1>
<p>You'll notice that there is no highlighting in <code>md_testrunner.py</code> below. The reason is that if I did that, it breaks the testing process.</p>
<pre><code>"""
Name: md_testrunner.py
Usage: python md_test_runner.py blogpost.md
Tested on: Python 3.7 and 3.8
"""
from sys import argv
import re
import subprocess

open_pattern = re.compile("\s*`{3}\s*python")
close_pattern = re.compile("\s*`{3}")
test_filename = "testfile.py"


def main(filename):
    # Create an array of the Python code called "code"
    code = []
    in_python = False
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            if re.match(open_pattern, line) is not None:
                in_python = True
                continue
            if in_python == True and re.match(close_pattern, line):
                in_python = False
            if in_python == True:
                code.append(line)

    # Save the code as a string to the testfile
    # `tempfile.NamedTempFile` fails here because the `write()` doesn't seem to occur
    # until the `with` statement is finished. I would love to be wrong in that, using
    # a tempfile is the cleaner approach. Please let me know a better approach.
    with open(test_filename, mode="w") as f:
        f.writelines("".join(code))

    # Run the code
    cmd = ["python", test_filename]
    proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    output, error = proc.communicate()

    # Display the results
    print("Output: " + output.decode("ascii"))
    print("Error: " + error.decode("ascii"))
    print("Code: " + str(proc.returncode))

    # Cleanup
    os.remove(test_filename)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(argv[1])
</code></pre>
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>While this meets my requirements, there is lots of room for improvements. If you're so inclined, here are some ideas to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it more fault tolerant. For example, <code>sys.argv[1]</code> is fragile for gathering CLI arguments.</li>
<li>Package it up so others can use it.</li>
<li>Add capability to run against multiple files.</li>
<li>Figure out how to make it not break the testing process if code highlighting is turned on itself.</li>
<li>Include capability to test other languages.</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why and how I'm moving my blog to vuepress.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/writing-new-blog-engine">In 2018 I wrote my own blog engine</a> and it's time to move off.</p>
<h1>Tooling is fun until it isn't</h1>
<p>I like writing code and thought this was going to be a fun, easy project. How hard is it to write a blog engine anyway?</p>
<p>The truth is I would rather be writing or coding new things then building and maintaining something that's been done thousands of times by other people. Yes, the foundation of a blog isn't hard, but the challenge is in the details. Here are some bits of grief I encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/writing-new-blog-engine.html#falling-off-the-mountain">Falling off the mountain</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing-new-blog-engine.html#climbing-a-frozen-mountain">Climbing a frozen mountain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-flask</a> allowed me to turn my site into a static site. However, <strong>the compilation time took over 5 minutes</strong>. While I ran my site locally on localhost, testing out additional features to see how they rendered in the final build took too long. For example, my plans to optimize page/image loads and add search came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>The end result was that for all my fun in writing the Mountain blog engine for myself, I felt uncomfortable with the results. Every time I visited my blog to write I would see the problems in the current system, try to fix them, then step away.</p>
<p>It's been time to migrate my blog for a while.</p>
<h2>Choosing a new blog engine</h2>
<p>A few months ago I wrote up these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be a static site because <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> rocks.</li>
<li>If not using .html extension, must easily redirect from .html to as not to annoy old readers. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/">Netlify's redirects</a> are perfect for this kind of thing.</li>
<li>Search needs to be a thing.</li>
<li>Powered by <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> because it's my favorite frontend framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when I saw that my coworker, <a href="https://www.amandaquint.com">Amanda Quint</a> had started a Vuepress blog I decided to give it a try. Setup was easy, but as always the challenge was in the details.</p>
<h2>Migration challenges</h2>
<p>My current blog is over 7 years old and has over 130 articles. I ran into a number of problems with converting from a forgiving blog engine I wrote to something designed to prevent you from having missing content. There was also coming up with a theme.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, my co-worker and friend <a href="https://www.ahmadmostafa.com/">Ahmad Mostafa</a> helped me out. Together we converted my blog over. He did a ton of work on my blog conversion and for that I am very thankful. I look forward to collaborating with him in the future.</p>
<h2>Moving back to GitHub</h2>
<p>Yes, I'm hosting my blog repo on <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/pydanny-v2/">GitHub</a> again. While I've been a user of GitLab for many years, and vastly prefer it for private projects, GitHub is where most the open source communities I'm involved in lives. Time to come back.</p>
<h2>Going forward</h2>
<p>We'll be making changes in the days to come. Some things we'll be doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add page transitions like what <a href="https://www.amandaquint.com">Amanda</a> has on her blog.</li>
<li>Increase the accessibility of the design.</li>
<li>Change the front page hero panel in some way.</li>
<li>Write more articles!</li>
</ol>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musings ten years after I decided to take my life in a new direction.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago today I acted on a decision to change my life. It was unbelievably hard to do, but thanks to family and friends I got through it.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>On the surface, my life looked wonderful. I worked at NASA, spent a lot of my free time at the gym or playing table-top games, bicycled 100-150 miles a week, posted on my current blog a lot more frequently, had been doing Python professionally for three years, and Django was still brand new to me. My career was going forward and I was excited. In theory, the future was bright.</p>
<p>In reality I was desperate. I was in a poisonous relationship. I'll not write down the details but suffice to say I was absolutely miserable.</p>
<p>At PyCon 2009 (my second PyCon) I came out of my shell and embraced the community there. It was uplifting and I realized that my working at NASA wasn't just a fluke, I was worthy enough to have the respect of people from around the world. And that respect was eye opening to me. I realized that there might be a world out there where people valued me.</p>
<h1>May 5th, 2009</h1>
<p>Ten years ago today (May 5th, 2009) I said goodbye and walked out into the rainy night. I had a backpack of clothes, my work laptop, and my wallet with not much money in it. I went to my gym and stayed the night(I had keys). While I was there I called a few family and friends and told them what I had done.</p>
<h1>The Months That Followed</h1>
<p>It wasn't easy to move forward, and there were times of desperation. I was in a terrible financial state (monies owed plus legal obligations) and bitterly angry for having not walked away years earlier.</p>
<p>Yet thanks to family and friends I found my way to a happier, more stable, and more productive life. I've paid most of them back one way or another. Those who I haven't paid back I've done my best to pay their assistance forward. They inspired me to help others improve their careers and lives.</p>
<h1>The Years That Followed</h1>
<p>At PyCon 2010 I met and fell in love with the first love of my life, Audrey Roy Greenfeld. I moved to California at the end of 2010. In 2012 we started writing books together. We married in 2013. Together in January of 2019 we had a baby girl, Uma Roy Greenfeld, the second love of my life.</p>
<p>I've improved my family relationships. Even when we're clashing I can tell them that I love them.</p>
<p>I lost many of my old friends and made new ones. Losing friends hurt, especially when I know I'm at least partially responsible. I can be a jerk at times and there were years of lingering bitterness from the days before May 5th, 2009. I've been reaching out to old friends, but it's not easy. On the other hand, I have wonderful new friends.</p>
<p>Professionally my career has gone well. I've freelanced, worked for startups, and some big firms. My current job at <a href="https://octopusenergy.com">Octopus Energy</a> is exactly where I want to be.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fighting the local_settings.py antipattern]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's an anti-pattern in the development world, and it's for using executable code as a means to store configuration values. In the Python universe, you sometimes see things like this in settings modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Warning: This is an anti-pattern!
try:
    from .local_settings import *
except ImportError:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>What people do is have a <code>local_settings.py</code> file that has been identified in a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Therefore, for local development you have your project running through an <strong>executable code file outside of version control</strong>.</p>
<p>If this sounds uncomfortable to you, then you are on the right track. Executable code <strong>always</strong> needs to be in version control.</p>
<p>A better approach is to place secrets and keys into environment variables. If you don't like that, or can't use it due to your environment, stick those values into JSON, YAML, or TOML files.</p>
<p>So what can happen if you allow the <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern into your project?</p>
<h3>The <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern</h3>
<p>The <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern means that you can have executable code in production that usually can't be viewed by developers trying to debug problems. If you've ever experience it, this is one of the worst production debugging nightmares.</p>
<h3>It worked fine on my laptop!</h3>
<p>What works locally and tests successfully can throw subtle bugs that won't be discovered until it's too late. Here's a real-world example of what can happen that I helped resolve for a client last year:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project had been using a third-party package for slugification for years. Configuration done in settings.</li>
<li>Developer decided to write their own slugification project. Worked great locally, so they made changes across the site to account for the new behavior.</li>
<li>Tests did not account for edge cases in the new slugification library.</li>
<li>Appeared to work in local development, staging, and even production.</li>
<li>A few days later customers in certain regions of the world started to complain about records being unreachable.</li>
<li>No one can figure out why production is behaving differently.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was brought in (and I billed them). First thing I check is for this sad code snippet in their settings modules</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Warning: This is an anti-pattern!
try:
    from .local import *
except ImportError:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>They had <code>executable</code> code outside of version control. What worked for the developer, didn't work the same everywhere else. Enough that it caused subtle bugs that weren't caught by humans or formal tests. Subtle developer bugs grew into serious bugs when encountered by real users.</p>
<p>And what was really bad is that these serious bugs were impossible to debug at first because the deployed code didn't match what was in someone's <code>local_settings.py</code> file.</p>
<h3>But I won't make these mistakes!</h3>
<p>People often say indignantly, "I'm not stupid like you, I don't make this kind of mistake."</p>
<p>Yet about once a year for the past 20 years I resolve or help resolve an issue stemming from executable code that wasn't tracked in version control.</p>
<p>I believe that all of us coders, no matter how talented and experienced, can and will make stupid mistakes. That's why good engineers/coders follow best practices - to help catch ourselves when we do something stupid. If you believe you can personally avoid making stupid mistakes in programming, I've got a bridge in New York City I can sell you.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, why not do the <code>smart</code> thing and put all executable code in version control? You can put your secrets and keys in environment variables or configuration files. Done! Argument over!</p>
<h3>How to handle location specific variables</h3>
<p>Use either either environment variables or config files. Really. And don't take my word for it, look at all the deployment tools and hosting services that recommend it (all of them do).</p>
<p>To do this, either figure out your own process for handling them or use a third-party package. Personally, for Django I like the simplicity of having this function in my various settings modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Good code!
from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured


def get_env_var(var_name):
    try:
        return os.environ[var_name]
    except KeyError:
        error_msg = f"Set the {var_name} environment variable"
        raise ImproperlyConfigured(error_msg)


SECRET_KEY = get_env_var("SECRET_KEY")
</code></pre>
<h3>I wrote a book to stop antipatterns</h3>
<p>In 2012 I kept getting offered rescue projects because people were using anti-patterns, especially this one. It was frustrating to see the same mistakes again and again. So I started to write a book, <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">Two Scoops of Django</a>, designed to instruct people on how not to fall into anti-patterns like the one described in this article.</p>
<p>If you don't want to buy my <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">book</a>, please read and embrace the config section of <a href="https://12factor.net/config">The Twelve Factor App</a>. Your future self will thank me for it.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting DRF, JWT, Axios, and Vue to play nice]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/vuelogo.png" alt="VueJS Logo"></p>
<p>Getting Django Rest Framework, JWT, Axios, and Vue.js to play nice isn't easy. Here's my quick-and-dirty cheatsheet that I wrote while glueing the pieces together.</p>
<p>Note: My architecture doesn't use django-webpack-loader. Instead, I'm running Django and Vue.js as two separate projects. I do this because I <strong>much prefer</strong> generating new projects with <code>vue create</code> over configuring webpack.</p>
<h2>The Back-End</h2>
<p>First, install some Django parts using the installer of your choice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install Django
pip install djangorestframework
pip install django-cors-headers
pip install djangorestframework-jwt
</code></pre>
<p>Then, configure Django in <code>settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'corsheaders',
)

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
  ...
  'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
)

CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = False
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = (
    # TODO - set this properly for production
    'https://127.0.0.1:8080',
    'https://127.0.0.1:8000',
)

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        # By default we set everything to admin,
        #   then open endpoints on a case-by-case basis
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser',
    ),
    'TEST_REQUEST_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.renderers.MultiPartRenderer',
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
        'rest_framework.renderers.TemplateHTMLRenderer'
    ),
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_jwt.authentication.JSONWebTokenAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 20,
}

from datetime import timedelta

JWT_AUTH = {
    'JWT_ALLOW_REFRESH': True,
    'JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA': timedelta(hours=1),
    'JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DELTA': timedelta(days=7),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once that's done, it's time to do modify the <code>urls.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.conf.urls import include, url
...

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    # JWT auth
    url(r'^api/v1/auth/obtain_token/', obtain_jwt_token),
    url(r'^api/v1/auth/refresh_token/', refresh_jwt_token),
    # The rest of the endpoints
    url(r'^api/v1/', include('project.api', namespace='apiv1')),
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>Run the tests and fix them as they fail.</p>
<h2>The Front-End</h2>
<p>First off, add this to your Vuex store:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import Vue from "vue";
import Vuex from "vuex";
import axios from "axios";

Vue.use(Vuex);

// Make Axios play nice with Django CSRF
axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = "csrftoken";
axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = "X-CSRFToken";

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    authUser: {},
    isAuthenticated: false,
    jwt: localStorage.getItem("token"),
    endpoints: {
      // TODO: Remove hardcoding of dev endpoints
      obtainJWT: "https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/obtain_token/",
      refreshJWT: "https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/refresh_token/",
      baseUrl: "https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/",
    },
  },

  mutations: {
    setAuthUser(state, { authUser, isAuthenticated }) {
      Vue.set(state, "authUser", authUser);
      Vue.set(state, "isAuthenticated", isAuthenticated);
    },
    updateToken(state, newToken) {
      // TODO: For security purposes, take localStorage out of the project.
      localStorage.setItem("token", newToken);
      state.jwt = newToken;
    },
    removeToken(state) {
      // TODO: For security purposes, take localStorage out of the project.
      localStorage.removeItem("token");
      state.jwt = null;
    },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in a Vue component called something like <code>components/Login.vue</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;template lang="html">
  &#x3C;form class="login form">
    &#x3C;div class="field">
      &#x3C;label for="id_username">Username&#x3C;/label>
      &#x3C;input
        v-model="username"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Username"
        autofocus="autofocus"
        maxlength="150"
        id="id_username"
      />
    &#x3C;/div>
    &#x3C;div class="field">
      &#x3C;label for="id_password">Password&#x3C;/label>
      &#x3C;input
        v-model="password"
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        id="id_password"
      />
    &#x3C;/div>
    &#x3C;button @click.prevent="authenticate" class="button primary" type="submit">
      Log In
    &#x3C;/button>
  &#x3C;/form>
&#x3C;/template>

&#x3C;script>
  import axios from "axios";

  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        username: "",
        password: "",
      };
    },
    methods: {
      authenticate() {
        const payload = {
          username: this.username,
          password: this.password,
        };
        axios
          .post(this.$store.state.endpoints.obtainJWT, payload)
          .then((response) => {
            this.$store.commit("updateToken", response.data.token);
            // get and set auth user
            const base = {
              baseURL: this.$store.state.endpoints.baseUrl,
              headers: {
                // Set your Authorization to 'JWT', not Bearer!!!
                Authorization: `JWT ${this.$store.state.jwt}`,
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
              },
              xhrFields: {
                withCredentials: true,
              },
            };
            // Even though the authentication returned a user object that can be
            // decoded, we fetch it again. This way we aren't super dependant on
            // JWT and can plug in something else.
            const axiosInstance = axios.create(base);
            axiosInstance({
              url: "/user/",
              method: "get",
              params: {},
            }).then((response) => {
              this.$store.commit("setAuthUser", {
                authUser: response.data,
                isAuthenticated: true,
              });
              this.$router.push({ name: "Home" });
            });
          })
          .catch((error) => {
            console.log(error);
            console.debug(error);
            console.dir(error);
          });
      },
    },
  };
&#x3C;/script>

&#x3C;style lang="css">&#x3C;/style>
</code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There you have it, my quick-and-dirty notes on getting Django REST Framework, JWT, Axios, and Vue.js to play nice together. Be aware there are a two significant problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not happy about using local storage, especially with JWT. In fact, my good friend Randall Degges has written about the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/17/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens">problems of JWT</a>.</li>
<li>I don't cover logging out. ;)</li>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/writing-new-blog-engine"/>
        <updated>2018-03-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where I describe why and how I wrote a new blog engine]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/EverestfromKalarPatarcrop.JPG" alt="Everest from Kalar Patar"></p>
<p>Since around February of 2012, I've been publishing this blog as a static HTML site using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. The experience was pretty good, but over time I ran into a few problems with the fact that I never upgraded the site to match current versions of Pelican. Which meant the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My RSS feed didn't follow the modern W3C RSS/Atom specifications. So I haven't been published in <a href="https://https://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</a> in years.</li>
<li>As time went by, upgrading to modern Pelican became harder and harder. And trying to get it to work wasn't much fun either.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I started looking at other options. My requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All my old page links needed to work. I didn't want to have to cook up some kind of redirect system.</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to make customizations without fighting through a complex extension system.</li>
<li>Theming needed to be easy.</li>
<li>Markdown needed to be supported. While I like RestructuredText, the honest truth is that I can pour out my thoughts faster with Markdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those requirements in mind, I got started reviewing other tools. I tried a bunch of options (Hugo, Lektor, Pelican again, etc) but none of them met my requirements to the degree I wanted.</p>
<h2>Climbing the Moutain</h2>
<p>Eventually, I decided the best course of action was to write my own blog engine with <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> and host it on AWS Lambda via <a href="https://github.com/miserlou/zappa">Zappa</a> with a JSON and Markdown backend. Using Flask and Zappa seemed like a good fit for me.</p>
<p>The reason is that while our core engine at work is always Django, we use Flask on AWS Lambda to power many microservices. For persistence we have DynamoDB/Redis or Django-powered APIs.</p>
<p>So one day this month I wrote up a blog engine that suited my requirements. I flung a theme on it and deployed it to AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>Hooray! Mission accomplished!</p>
<h2>Falling Off the Mountain</h2>
<p>With pleasure, I asked friends to take a look at my new blog system. Immediately these friends started to tell me it was running slow.</p>
<p>You see, it turns out if you load a <strong>huge JSON</strong> file for each page load AND render markdown on the server side, your site is going to be slow. Even after numerous optimizations the pages still loaded in seconds.</p>
<h2>Climbing a Frozen Mountain</h2>
<p>I thought about writing something to convert the JSON to native python objects. Or using an S3-located SQLite3 backend. But that felt like a lot of work to me and I wanted to get to writing.</p>
<p>That's when my awesome wife suggested I render the blog out as static HTML and just put that on S3. She said if I needed custom elements, that's what I could host those on AWS Lambda via Zappa and load them with Javascript.</p>
<p>Inspired by her idea, I installed <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a> and a few minutes later I had a static version of my blog. I removed the pagination and was done.</p>
<h2>Inside the Mountain</h2>
<p>My new blog is built and deployed with the following backend components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>Boto3</li>
<li>Markdown2</li>
<li>feedgen</li>
<li>Django (because it has the best <code>truncatewords_html</code> tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>The markdown files that make up the content have metadata stored as JSON. That makes it easy to read and parse, but I have considered switching to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML</a>.</p>
<p>Looking out the window a few days ago I came up with a name for my blog engine: "Mountain".</p>
<h2>Why Flask? Why Not Django?</h2>
<p>Because Flask is better at doing work that doesn't involve SQL. And I don't want a SQL-powered blog. I want something that lets me write in markdown using my text editor. Mountain lets me do precisely that.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Here are some things I plan to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch from Disqus-powered comments to GitHub issue powered ones.</li>
<li>Take a look at switching the metadata from JSON to TOML.</li>
<li>Write an AWS Lambda-powered search backend for the blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The end result of this is you'll probably see me writing more blog entries in the days to come. Mountain works exactly how I want it. It has removed some of the hindrances that slowed me down.</p>
<p>In fact, this is my first blog post written in Markdown on the new blog. How cool is that?</p>

<p>This is what will hopefully be the first in a series of reference
articles for using <a href="https://www.coreapi.org/">Core API</a> libraries with
Django REST Framework (<a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">DRF</a>).</p>
<p>This is an extraction from an existing production view running Django
1.11/2.0 on Python 3.6. The original code did something else, but for
contract reasons I'm demonstrating this code with sending email.</p>
<p>Please note that this article is very terse, with almost no description,
no tests, and no URL routing. Just enough code so that if you have a
decent understand of DRF, you can make custom views work with Core API.</p>
<p>First, the serializer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># serializers.py
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from markdown import markdown
from rest_framework import serializers


class EmailSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    to_addresses = serializers.ListField(
        child=serializers.EmailField(),
        required=True
    )
    from_email = serializers.EmailField(required=True)
    subject = serializers.CharField(required=True)
    message = serializers.CharField(required=True)
    htmlize = serializer.BooleanField(required=False, default=False)

    def create(self, validated_data):
        if validated_data['htmlize']:
            validated_data['html_message'] = markdown(validated_data['message'])

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/when-to-use-mongodb-with-django"/>
        <updated>2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short answer is you don't use MongoDB with Django. Read on for the specifics.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Short Answer</h1>
<p>You don't.</p>
<h1>Long Answer</h1>
<p>First off, let's get one thing out of the way. This isn't a bash on
MongoDB. MongoDB works great with lots of things (Flask, Tornado, Node,
etc), but it's a mismatch with Django. In other words, this article is
about using the right tool for the right job.</p>
<p>Second, I'm not speaking from ignorance. In fact, I have quite a bit of
experience combining MongoDB and Django. You can see some of my early
work with combining these tools in the defunct
<a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-mongonaut">django-mongonaut</a>.</p>
<p>Okay then, let's get into the background of this post: On various
Django help forums, you'll hear requests from new-ish Django developers
on how to use MongoDB with Django. Most of the time they want to replace
the Django ORM with calls to MongoDB. Here are the reasons I've heard
so far.</p>
<h1>The 90% Reason: JSON storage</h1>
<p>Most of the time people want to replace SQL with MongoDB in Django, the
reason is they want to store JSON data and search it.</p>
<p>In which case, they should use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#jsonfield">Django's built-in implementation of
PostgreSQL's JSON
field</a>.
It's not just a string field, it's fully searchable. Implementation
example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.contrib.postgres.fields import JSONField
from django.db import models


class Product(models.Model):

    metadata = JSONField(null=True, blank=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Just save your data into this field using a JSON-serializable dict.
It's that easy. Even better, in this previous
<a href="/pretty-formatting-json-django-admin.html">article</a>,
I show how you can pretty print the JSON in the Django admin.</p>
<p>Using this field, you get all the built-in features of Django and a
searchable JSON field without the mess of stapling a non-relational
database (MongoDB) into a framework and vibrant ecosystem designed to
work with relational databases (Django).</p>
<p>For those using MySQL instead of PostgreSQL, there's always
Django-MySQL's
<a href="https://django-mysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_fields/json_field.html">jsonfield</a>.</p>
<h1>The 5% Reason: Performance</h1>
<p>A fraction of people want to use MongoDB with Django because of supposed
performance reasons. Sure, if you run MongoDB without any write
safeguards and decide to forego database transactions, it will run
faster than any relational storage. However, that's a dangerously
insecure approach to things. It's simply not worth the risk of
corrupted data.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it, spend an hour searching for articles about
write safety in MongoDB. Ignore the hype articles published by
mongodb.com, read what real businesses and projects case studies have to
say.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to speed database i/o up with Django, standard
practice is to employ asynchronous tools such as Celery before switching
out the datastore.</p>
<h1>The 4% Reason: Scaling Up</h1>
<p>Anyone who tells you that relational databases can't scale as well as
MongoDB (or anything else) is selling you something. Or was sold on
something and don't want to admit they bought the hype.</p>
<p>Again, don't take my word for it, spend an hour searching for articles
about scaling issues with MongoDB. Again, ignore the marketing and read
real case studies.</p>
<h1>The 1% Reason: Management</h1>
<p>Every once in a while someone tells me that using MongoDB with Django is
a management decision. In which case, they should send their boss(es) to
this blog post.</p>
<p>Management should know that Django is designed to be used with a
relational database backend (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and a key/value store
for ephemeral data (Redis, Memcached). Going beyond that design is going
to make development slower and frustrate the team. Even if your team can
work around this issue, they'll be hampered by not being able to fully
exploit tools within the Django ecosystem.</p>
<h1>If You Must Use MongoDB, Use Flask Instead</h1>
<p>There's nothing wrong with MongoDB. However, it's suboptimal when used
with Django. If you use it with correct write permissions, MongoDB
doesn't provide any speed benefits with Django. You also lose many of
the advantages of Django (database transactions, rock-solid security,
forms, easy Django REST framework use, hundreds of third-party packages,
etc). There is quite a lot of things you are going to have to rewrite.</p>
<p>And if you're going to have to rewrite that much of Django's
functionality to use MongoDB, you might as well be using Flask.
Honestly, this isn't a bad choice, as the flexibility of Flask makes it
perfect for use with non-relational databases.</p>
<p>I know, because this is how we use Flask on the job, which is not with
relational data. We have dozens of microservices that rely on DynamoDB.
While DynamoDB isn't MongoDB, they are similar enough that I can tell
you this approach is delightful. Keep an eye out for my upcoming article
about it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/"><img src="/images/lasergun.jpg" alt="Lasergun Light Painting"></a></p>
<h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<p>The last time I wrote down resolutions was way back in 2014. I had done
it for many years at that point, dating back to even before my old blog.
Somehow I fell out of what I consider a positive habit. Well, it's time
to pick it up again!</p>
<p>So here are my resolutions for 2018:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weight down to 160.</li>
<li>Work out for 60 minutes a day. I got lazy in the last year.</li>
<li>Start martial arts again. Because of knee and ankle injuries,
Capoeira is probably right out. Already up Kali/Escrima under
<a href="https://valleycapoeira.com/about-us/contra-mestreguro-xingu/">Guro</a>
Mestre Xingú instead.</li>
<li>Write at least 3 books (last year we did 5 books, so this is
doable!). Out of those, one will be about coding in some way.</li>
<li>Blog at least once a month, about anything. Python, Django,
serverless coding, martial arts, whatever. And with this post,
January is done!</li>
<li>Release some coding projects I can't talk about yet.</li>
<li>Travel outside the USA. That looks to be a trip to Colombia to speak
at <a href="https://www.pycon.co">PyCon Colombia</a>! If you are in South
America, please meet me (and Audrey) there! I'll be sharing more
details soon. :-)</li>
</ol>
<p>note: The photo is from a light painting session I did with Audrey at
the start of last year.</p>

<p>Today is a special day. You see, the latest fantasy book I co-authored,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-Spring/dp/B071P74C8Z/?tag=ihpydanny-20">Coldest Spring (3rd in the Ambria
series)</a>,
is out AND it's my birthday. In honor of of these occasions, the first
book of the series, Darkest Autumn, for 0.99 cents on Amazon. Plus, I'm
doing a Python-related giveaway.</p>
<p><strong>The Giveaway:</strong> There's a python programming easter egg in the book.
One of the characters mentions the elegance of Python. The first person
who tells me in the comments below the name of the father and
grandfather of that character gets an autographed <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">Two Scoops of Django

        <updated>2017-05-15T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Python to combine multiple Google docs into one cohesive whole that can be published as a book.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/using-google-docs-and-python-to-assemble-fiction-books.html"><img src="/images/python-tip-from-pydanny.png" alt="Python tips and tricks"></a></p>
<p>When I started my latest fiction book, <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/products/darkest-autumn-ambria-book-1">The Darkest
Autumn</a>, I
wrote out the chapters as individual files. I did it in a text editor
(Sublime) and saved the files to a git repo. The names of the files
determined their order, chapters being named in this pattern:</p>
<pre><code>the-darkest-autumn $ tree
.
├── 01_Beginnings.md
├── 02_Town_of_Ravenna.md
├── 03_Walls_of_Ravenna.md
</code></pre>
<p>As the book developed I thought about moving it to
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>. If you
don't know, Scrivener is an excellent tool for writing. It encourages
you to break up your work into chapters and scenes. The downside is that
Scrivener is complex (I want to write, not figure out software) and
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#x26;t=11725">Scrivener isn't designed for simultaneous
collaboration</a>.
The latter issue is a very serious problem, as I like to have others
review and comment on my writing as I go.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to do is combine the chapter breaking of Scrivener
with the simplicity and collaboration of Google Docs. Preferably, I
would put the book chapters into Google Docs as individual files and
then send invites to my editor, wife, and my beta readers. By using
Google Docs I could ensure anyone could access the work without having
to create a new account and learn an unfamiliar system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time Google Docs has no way to combine multiple
Google Docs contained in one directory into one large document for
publication. To use Google Docs thhe way I want involves manually
copy/pasting content from dozens of files into one master document any
time you want to update a work. With even 5 to 10 documents this is time
consuming and error prone (for me) to the point of being unusable. This
is a problem because my fiction books have anywhere from 30 to 50
chapters.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I know how to code. By using the Python programming
language, I can automate the process of combining the Google Docs into
one master file which can be converted to epub, mobi (kindle), or PDF.</p>
<h1>How I Combine Google Doc Files</h1>
<p>First, I download all the files in the book's Google Docs directory.</p>
<p><img src="/images/selecting-files.png?12346" alt="Selecting Files With Google Docs"></p>
<p>This generates and downloads a zip file called something like
drive-download-20170505T230011Z-001.zip. I use <code>unzip to open it</code>:</p>
<pre><code>unzip drive-download-20170505T230011Z-001.zip -d the-darkest-autumn
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the new the-darkest-autumn folder are a bunch of MS
Word-formatted files named identically to what's stored on Google Docs:</p>
<pre><code>$ tree the-darkest-autumn/
the-darkest-autumn
├── 01. Beginnings.docx
├── 02. Town of Ravenna.docx
├── 03. Walls of Ravenna.docx
├── 04. Gatehouse of Ravenna.docx
├── 05. Courage.docx
├── 06. To the Upper Valley.docx
├── _afterward.docx
├── _copyright.docx
├── _dedication.docx
└── _title.docx
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's time to bring in the code. By leveraging the
<a href="https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">python-docx</a> library,
I combine all the Word files into one large Word files using this Python
(3.6 or higher) script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">"""bookify.py: Combines multiple Word docs in a folder.

<p>This is what it looks like when I run the code:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>And now I've got a Word document in the same directory called
the-darkest-autumn.docx.</p>
<h1>Converting Word to EPUB</h1>
<p>While Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) will accept .docx files, I like to
convert it to .epub using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ebook-convert the-darkest-autumn.docx the-darkest-autumn.epub \
--authors "Daniel Roy Greenfeld" \
--publisher "Two Scoops Press" \
--series Ambria \
--series-index 1 \
--output-profile kindle
</code></pre>
<p>And now I can check out my results by using Calibre's book viewer:</p>
<pre><code>$ ebook-viewer the-darkest-autumn.epub
</code></pre>
<h1>Add the Links!</h1>
<p>As <code>python-docx</code> doesn't handle HTTP links at this time, I manually add
them to the book using Calibre's epub editor. I add links to:</p>
<ul>
<li>My personal author site at
<a href="https://www.danielroygreenfeld.com/">danielroygreenfeld.com</a></li>
<li>The book's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/the-darkest-autumn-ebook/product-reviews/B071L2G8SL?tag=mlinar-20">review page on
Amazon</a></li>
<li>The book's upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.danielroygreenfeld.com/books/the-river-runs-uphill/">The River Runs
Uphill</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How Well Does It Work?</h1>
<p>For me it works wonders for my productivity. By following a "chapters
as files" pattern within Google Docs I get solid collaboration power
plus some (but not all) of the features of Scrivener. I can quickly
regenerate the book at any time without having to struggle with
Scrivener or have to add tools like Vellum to the process.</p>
<p>I have a secondary script that fixes quoting and tab issues, written
before I realized Calibre could have done that for me.</p>
<p>The book I started this project for, <a href="https://www.danielroygreenfeld.com/books/the-darkest-autumn/">The Darkest
Autumn</a>,
is available now on
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkest-Autumn-Ambria-I-ebook/dp/B071L2G8SL/?tag=mlinar-20">Amazon</a>.
Check it out and let me know what you think of what the script
generates. Or if you want to support my writing (both fiction and
non-fiction), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkest-Autumn-Ambria-I-ebook/dp/B071L2G8SL/?tag=mlinar-20">buy The Darkest Autumn on
Amazon</a>
and leave an honest review.</p>
<h1>Thinking About the Future</h1>
<p>Right now this snippet of code generates something that looks okay, but
could be improved. I plan to enhance it with better fonts and chapter
headers, the goal to generate something as nice as what
<a href="https://draft2digital.com/">Draft2Digital</a> generates.</p>
<p>I've considered adding the OAuth components necessary in order to allow
for automated downloading. The problem is I loathe working with OAuth.
Therefore I'm sticking with the manial download process.</p>
<p>For about a week I thought about leveraging it and my
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> skills to build it as a paid
subscription service and rake in the passive income. Basically turn it
into a startup. After some reflection I backed off because if Google
added file combination as a feature, it would destroy the business
overnight.</p>
<p>I've also decided not to package this up on Github/PyPI. While
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> makes it trivial
for me to do this kind of thing, I'm not interested in maintaining yet
another open source project. However, if someone does package it up and
credits me for my work, I'm happy to link to it from this blog post.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-f-strings-are-fun</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-f-strings-are-fun"/>
        <updated>2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/python-f-strings-are-fun.html"><img src="/images/python-tip-from-pydanny.png" alt="Python F-Strings Are Fun!"></a></p>
<p>In python 3.6 we saw the adoption of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">Literal String
Interpolation</a>, or as they
are known more commonly,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings">f-strings</a>.
At first I was hesitant because... well... we've got multiple string
tools already available:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">one, two = 1, 2
_format = '{},{}'.format(one, two)
_percent = '%s,%s' % (one, two)
_concatenation = str(one) + ',' + str(two)
_join = ','.join((str(one),str(two)))
assert _format == _percent == _concatenation == _join
</code></pre>
<p>Adding f-strings to this mix didn't seem all that useful:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">_fstring = f'{one},{two}'
assert _fstring == _format == _percent == _concatenation == _join
</code></pre>
<p>I was doubtful, but then I tried out f-strings on a non-trivial example.
Now I'm hooked. Be it on local utility scripts or production code, I
now instinctively gravitate toward their usage. In fact, f-strings are
so useful that going back to earlier versions of Python now feels
cumbersome.</p>
<p>The reason why I feel this way is that f-strings are concise but easy to
understand. Thanks to intuitive expression evaluation I can compress
more verbose commands into smaller lines of code that are more legible.
Take a look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">_fstring = f'Total: {one + two}'  # Go f-string!
_format = 'Total: {}'.format(one + two)
_percent = 'Total: %s' % (one + two)
_concatenation = 'Total: ' + str(one + two)
assert _fstring == _format == _percent == _concatenation
</code></pre>
<p>The f-string example is four characters shorter than the closest
alternative and is extremely easy to read. Indeed, put the f-string
example in front of a non-programmer and they'll understand it fast.
The same won't apply to the alternatives, odds are they'll ask what
<code>.format()</code>, <code>str()</code>, and the <code>%</code> mean.</p>
<h1>F-Strings Are Addictive</h1>
<p>The conciseness and power of the intuitive expression evaluation can't
be understated. On the surface f-strings seem like a small step forward
for Python, but once I started using them I realized they were a huge
step in codability for the language.</p>
<p>Now I'm hooked. I'm addicted to f-strings. When I step back to Python
3.5 or lower I feel like less of a Python coder. Yes, I have a problem
with how much I lean on f-strings now, but I acknowledge my problem. I
would go to therapy for it, but I believe I can manage the addiction for
now.</p>
<p>Okay, enough joking, f-strings are awesome. Try them out.</p>
<h1>A Utility Script Example</h1>
<p>We just released <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">Two Scoops of Django
1.11</a>,
which is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. Like
most programming books we provide <a href="https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/tree/master/code">code examples in a
repo</a>
for our readers. However, as we completey revised the code-highlighting,
we had to rewrite our code extractor from the ground up. In a flurry of
cowboy coding, I did so in thirty minutes using Python 3.6 while leaning
on f-strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">"""Two Scoops of Django 1.11 Code Extractor"""

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>How to Improve Your Coding Skills</h1>
<p>This was my path. It may not be your path. This path also isn't in any
particular order, all of them apply from the moment you start on the
path.</p>
<ol>
<li>I coded. A lot. From silly little scripts to automating tasks to
attempting full-blown projects. At work or for fun. I failed a lot,
but learned along the way.</li>
<li>I didn't jump from language to language. Instead I stayed in a few
places for years and focused my learning on those tools. My 19+ year
career can be summed up as FoxPro then Java then Python. In the
middle of things I picked up JavaScript. Sure, I've dallied with a
few things (Lisp, Haskell, Lua, Perl, ColdFusion, Go), but by
staying focused on a small set of tools I'm better than mediocre.</li>
<li>I coded lots. Yes, this is a repeat of #1.</li>
<li>Once I got the basics of a language, I looked up best practices for
each of them. Then I religiously adhered to them, even becoming
dogmatic about it. In general this means my code is more easily
read. More easily debugged. And most importantly, more easily
shared.</li>
<li>Did I mention that I coded a lot? You can never get good at anything
unless you practice. Another repeat of #1.</li>
<li>I got over my fear/pride of asking questions. Well, mostly, I still
am afraid/prideful from time to time. Honestly, by asking questions
you aren't showing what you don't know, you are showing you are
willing to learn. Also, the simple act of figuring out how to ask a
question can put you in the right mindset to determine the answer
yourself.</li>
<li>As soon as I asked a question, whether or not I got an answer, I
coded some more. Code, code, code! Yet another repeat of #1</li>
<li>Once I've gotten the hang of a language, I looked for cookbooks
and/or pocket references on it. I prefer paper copies of tech books
(everything else I read is electronic). The recipes in cookbooks
become the foundation of my toolkit. The terse, easy-to-find
reminders in the pocket reference mean less cognitive overload.</li>
<li>I took those recipes and references and coded with them. Again and
again I coded. In work hours or play time. Practice makes perfect!
Why do I keep repeating #1?</li>
<li>Over the years I've stayed with the easiest-to-learn stable
IDEs/text editors. Yes, I know there are really powerful tools with
arcane commands (Vim, EMACS, etc), but I don't want to have to stop
what I'm doing to learn new tools. I want to code, not tinker with
desktop tools or arcane text editors.</li>
<li>And again, reference back to #1, I use the text editor to write
code. Code, code, code! Until my fingers and hands hurt, until I've
had to learn how to deal with carpal tunnel syndrome. Code, code,
code! It's like learning martial arts, guitar, or anything,
repetition of simple actions provides the confidence for you to
either combine those actions into something greater or learn
something more complex.</li>
</ol>
<h1>What I Wish I Had Done</h1>
<ul>
<li>Studied computer science. If I could do it all over again, that
would have been the focus of my academic studies. It wouldn't
replace anything on my list, the path I've defined remains the
same. Code, code, code!</li>
<li>It goes without saying I should have taken more tutorials. Nothing
gives a kickstart like having an instructor, online or in-person,
who guides you down the right path. Then you can code, code, code!</li>
</ul>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/pretty-formatting-json-django-admin"/>
        <updated>2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was writing code to interact with a third-party API. The API
changes frequently, especially the data contained in responses. However,
that data has to be saved and periodically needs to be audited. I wanted
a data model flexible enough to handle these periodic changes without a
lot of anguish, yet queryable. Since the API serves out queryable JSON,
this made it a no-brainer for using <code>django.contrib.postgres</code>'s
JSONField.</p>
<p>After a little bit of work, I had data samples to play with. Quickly my
admin filled with chunks of JSON that looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">{"field_12": 8, "field_16": 4, "field_6": 14, "field_7": 13, "field_18": 2, "field_2": 18, "field_4": 16, "field_15": 5, "field_9": 11, "field_3": 17, "field_8": 12, "field_11": 9, "field_17": 3, "field_10": 10, "field_0": 20, "field_1": 19, "field_13": 7, "field_5": 15, "field_14": 6}
</code></pre>
<p>Kind of illegible, right? And that's a simple, flat example with just
20 keys. Imagine if this were a nested dictionary with 100 or 200
fields. For reference, that's the kind of data that I had that makes
this kind of display nigh useless.</p>
<p>So I cooked up this quick fix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import json
from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import JsonLexer
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter

from django.contrib import admin
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

from .models import APIData


class APIDataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ('data_prettified',)

    def data_prettified(self, instance):
        """Function to display pretty version of our data"""

        # Convert the data to sorted, indented JSON
        response = json.dumps(instance.data, sort_keys=True, indent=2)

        # Truncate the data. Alter as needed
        response = response[:5000]

        # Get the Pygments formatter
        formatter = HtmlFormatter(style='colorful')

        # Highlight the data
        response = highlight(response, JsonLexer(), formatter)

        # Get the stylesheet
        style = "&#x3C;style>" + formatter.get_style_defs() + "&#x3C;/style>&#x3C;br>"

        # Safe the output
        return mark_safe(style + response)

    data_prettified.short_description = 'data prettified'

admin.site.register(APIData, APIDataAdmin)
</code></pre>
<p>The field remains the same, but we also get a display of nicely
formatted data:</p>
<p><img src="/images/admin-pretty-json.png" alt="Admin Pretty JSON">]</p>
<p>Much better!</p>
<p>There may be a package out there that does this already, perhaps even
using a JavaScript library like hightlight.js instead of pygments. If
not, it shouldn't be hard to create one using <a href="/how-to-create-installable-django-packages.html">Cookiecutter Django
Package</a>.
Let me know if you package this and I'll add it to this blog post.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/how-to-create-installable-django-packages.html"><img src="/images/django-package-470x246.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>What I mean by an "installable Django package": a reusable component
that can be shared across Django projects, allowing us to combine our
own efforts with others. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/p/django-test-plus/">django-test-plus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/p/django-crispy-forms/">django-crispy-forms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/p/dj-stripe/">dj-stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/p/dj-spam/">dj-spam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ever want to quickly create a similarly installable Django package to
submit to <a href="pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://wwww.djangopackages.com">Django
Packages</a>? One that goes beyond the
basics described in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/reusable-apps/">Django
tutorial</a>?
Specifically, a package that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test runner so you don't need a example/test project (Although
those can be useful).</li>
<li>The important configuration in place: Travis, editorconfig,
gitignore, etc.</li>
<li>The important documentation in place: Readme, License, Read the
Docs-ready Sphinx docs, etc.</li>
<li>Static files ready to go.</li>
<li>A base DTL/Jinja2 template ready to go.</li>
<li>All those other fiddly bits not included in
<code>django-admin.py startapp</code> that are hard to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, here's how I do it.</p>
<h1>Introducing cookiecutter-djangopackage</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage">cookiecutter-djangopackage</a>
is a <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> template
for creating reusable Django packages. Using it is easy:</p>
<p>First, get <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a>.
Trust me, it's awesome:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip install cookiecutter
</code></pre>
<p>Now run it against this repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage.git
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be prompted to enter some values. Enter them. Then an
installable Django package will be built for you.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <code>app_name</code> must be a valid Python module name or you will
have issues on imports.</p>
<p>Enter the new package (in my case, I called it 'newpackage') and look
around. Open up the <code>AUTHORS.rst</code>, <code>setup.py</code>, or <code>README.rst</code> files and
you'll see your input inserted into the appropriate locations.</p>
<p>Speaking of the <code>README.rst</code>, that file includes instructions for
putting the new package on <a href="pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://wwww.djangopackages.com">Django
Packages</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">newpackage
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .travis.yml
├── AUTHORS.rst
├── CONTRIBUTING.rst
├── HISTORY.rst
├── LICENSE
├── MANIFEST.in

</code></pre>
<p>Now, instead of monkeying around for awhile doing copy/paste package
setup, I'm immediately ready to write code.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage">cookiecutter-djangopackage</a>
does a lot, but even with its tight focus on package creation it could
do more. Some of the things I would love to see included in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option for Appveyor CI support</li>
<li>Option to replace <code>django.test</code> with <code>py.test</code>.</li>
<li>Generation of model boilerplate, admin, and CRUD views.</li>
<li>More in the <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage/issues">issue
tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it out and let me know what you think. I'm open to new ideas and
receiving pull requests.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a> and I
had the privilege of teaching the US Air Force's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/91st_Cyberspace_Operations_Squadron">91st Cyberspace
Operations
Squadron</a>
the finer details of how to build, test, and deploy
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> web applications.</p>
<p><a href="/intensive-django-training-us-air-force.html"><img src="/images/two-scoops-academy-91cos-django-training.png" alt="Two Scoops Academy 91st COS Django Training"></a></p>
<p>It was a challenging, exciting experience for us as instructors. We've
taught numerous Python and Django trainings over the years under
<a href="https://www.cartwheelweb.com/training/">Cartwheel Web</a> , but this was
the first time we taught as <a href="https://www.twoscoopsacademy.com">Two Scoops
Academy</a> using our new system of
instruction.</p>
<p>The environment that the 91st Cyberspace Operations Squadron works in is
heavily isolated from the internet. What this means is that until
technology or information is approved, it is unavailable to the software
developers. While they can access Google, Stack Overflow, and Read the
Docs, reading the source on GitHub is something they do at home, not on
the job. This means they really need to understand their material. Our
experience with their team (already competent in other programming
tools) was that they were bright, focused, and willing to learn.</p>
<p>The class included material on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python, PEP8, PEP20, object oriented programming</li>
<li>Django and related best practices</li>
<li>Class-based views, ModelForms, and Forms</li>
<li>Using third-party Python/Django components</li>
<li>Bootstrapping projects with
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django">Cookiecutter-Django</a></li>
<li>PostgreSQL, pgAdmin III, and PyCharm's database tools</li>
<li>PyCharm settings, debugging, testing, and coverage integration</li>
<li>Bootstrap, SASS, CSS, and Grunt</li>
<li>Simple and advanced version control workflows with Git</li>
<li>APIs with Django REST Framework</li>
<li>Django project deployment with Docker</li>
<li>Custom material as requested by the US Air Force</li>
<li>Much more</li>
</ul>
<p>We readily admit taking our course material is like receiving a firehose
of knowledge to the face; that large portions probably won't make sense
for months. Yet as always with smart students, we could tell that the
core concepts of our curriculum were sticking.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the last day we switched to "project" mode,
where the class breaks up into small teams to begin trying to resolve
various in-house challenges. To our delight, challenges were completed
and real progress was made. As instructors, nothing is more exciting
than seeing your students succeed.</p>
<p>The class ended on a high note, but as always I'm sad that it's over.
Our host, Captain <a href="https://twitter.com/jondelmil">Jonathan D. Miller</a>,
was gracious and accommodating. The students were friendly and willing
to learn. I'm grateful to have taught them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lackland_Air_Force_Base">Lackland Air Force
Base</a>, and I look
forward to hearing about their successes in the future.</p>
<p>For more details, see Audrey's <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com2015/11/intensive-django-training-with-91st.html">blog
post</a>.</p>
<h1>Testimonial by Captain Jonathan D. Miller</h1>
<p>Here are some kind words that we received about the training we
provided:</p>
<p>Daniel and Audrey just ran the most effective, focused training course I've had the pleasure of attending. They worked tirelessly with me in the months leading up to the course so that it was tailored specifically for our squadron's development environment, and they followed up afterward to ensure that their slides were flawless for our continued reference.</p>
<p>At several points during the course, my developers took me aside to mention to me how impressed they were with the Greenfelds' quality of instruction, preparation, and attention to detail. Having two instructors was a true force multiplier -- we covered more ground on Python and Django than I thought possible. After four days we were already building working prototypes of our desired applications, and many in the class had never touched Python before!</p>
<p>Our squadron's return on investment for this course was remarkable. Daniel and Audrey have my strongest endorsement, and I know the 91st COS will be sending future developers.

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/titlecasing-markdown-headers-with-python"/>
        <updated>2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/title-case.png"><img src="/images/title-case.png" alt="Markdown"></a></p>
<p>Recently I've been writing a lot of Markdown. While not as
sophisticated as ReStructuredText, it's simplicity is nice for
accelerated writing. The problem is that I like to put section headings
in <em>titlecase</em>.</p>
<p>What do I mean by titlecase?</p>
<pre><code>go to the room
</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>Go to the Room
</code></pre>
<p>See how verb 'Go' and the noun 'Room' have their first letter
capitalized? And the 'small words', specifically 'to' (preposition)
and 'the' (definate article) are not? That's how title casing works
(at least in English). That's what I like to see in my section
headings.</p>
<p>In theory one could just use Python's <code>str.title()</code> method to perform
this transformation. However, that method is too global in reach. We
would end up with:</p>
<pre><code>Go To The Room  # 'to' and 'the' have titlecase, when they should not.
</code></pre>
<p>So how do I programmatically (i.e. quickly) ensure that dozens of files
scattered across multiple directories have section headers that are
accurately titlecased?</p>
<h1>Accurately Titlecasing Programmatically</h1>
<p>The solution to this is a handy library called
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/titlecase">titlecase</a>. Empowered by this
tool I wrote the following script that allows me to transforms all my
markdown files to have titlecased section headings.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">"""
Titlecases all markdown section headers in a directory.
Confirmed to work with Python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.

Usage:

  python titlemd.py a-directory/
  python titlemd.py  # defaults to '.'
"""

import fnmatch
import os
import sys

try:
  from titlecase import titlecase
except ImportError:
  print("Please install titlecase")

def main(location):
  for root, dirs, files in os.walk(location):
      for item in fnmatch.filter(files, "*.md"):
          file_path = os.path.join(root, item)
          print(file_path)

          # Open the file and read the lines as a list
          with open(file_path) as f:
              lines = f.readlines()

          with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
              # Loop through the list of lines and titlecase
              # any line beginning with '#'.
              for line in lines:
                  if line.strip().startswith('#'):
                      line = titlecase(line)
                  f.write(line)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  try:
      main(sys.argv[1])
  except IndexError:
      main('.')

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Why Doesn't Python Have Switch/Case?]]></title>
        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/why-doesnt-python-have-switch-case</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/why-doesnt-python-have-switch-case"/>
        <updated>2015-06-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/aliens.png"><img src="/images/aliens.png" alt="Aliens"></a></p>
<p>Unlike every other programming language I've used before, Python does
not have a switch or case statement. To get around this fact, we use
dictionary mapping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def numbers_to_strings(argument):
    switcher = {
        0: "zero",
        1: "one",
        2: "two",
    }
    return switcher.get(argument, "nothing")
</code></pre>
<p>This code is analogous to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function(argument){
    switch(argument) {
        case 0:
            return "zero";
        case 1:
            return "one";
        case 2:
            return "two";
        default:
            return "nothing";
    };
};
</code></pre>
<p>While the Python code is often more terse than the standard method of
handling cases, I could argue it is more arcane. When I first started
Python it felt weird and distracting. Over time it grew on me, the use
of a dictionary key being the identifier in a switch becoming more and
more habitual.</p>
<h1>Dictionary Mapping for Functions</h1>
<p>In Python we can also include functions or lambdas in our dictionary
mapping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def zero():
    return "zero"

def one():
    return "one"

def numbers_to_functions_to_strings(argument):
    switcher = {
        0: zero,
        1: one,
        2: lambda: "two",
    }
    # Get the function from switcher dictionary
    func = switcher.get(argument, lambda: "nothing")
    # Execute the function
    return func()
</code></pre>
<p>While the code inside <code>zero()</code> and <code>one</code> are simple, many Python
programs use dictionary mappings like this to dispatch complex
procedures.</p>
<h1>Dispatch Methods for Classes</h1>
<p>If we don't know what method to call on a class, we can use a dispatch
method to determine it at runtime.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Switcher(object):
    def numbers_to_methods_to_strings(self, argument):
        """Dispatch method"""
        # prefix the method_name with 'number_' because method names
        # cannot begin with an integer.
        method_name = 'number_' + str(argument)
        # Get the method from 'self'. Default to a lambda.
        method = getattr(self, method_name, lambda: "nothing")
        # Call the method as we return it
        return method()

    def number_0(self):
        return "zero"

    def number_1(self):
        return "one"

    def number_2(self):
        return "two"
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty nifty, right?</p>
<h1>The Official Answer</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#why-isn-t-there-a-switch-or-case-statement-in-python">official
answer</a>
says, "You can do this easily enough with a sequence of
<code>if... elif... elif... else</code>". And that you can use dictionary mapping
for functions and dispatch methods for classes.</p>
<p>Arguably the official answer doesn't explain anything except for
workarounds. In other words, a "non-answer". In my opinion, what the
official answer is really trying to say is, "Python doesn't need a
case statement."</p>
<h1>Really?</h1>
<p>Yup. But there's more. I've heard people I respect say that
switch/case statements in code can be really hard to debug.</p>
<p>Personally I find that argument breaks down as soon as you run into
gigantic nested dictionaries used for mapping of code branches. Think
about it, a 100+ element nested dictionary is just as hard to debug as a
nested switch and case block with 100+ cases.</p>
<h1>Maybe Dictionary Mapping Runs Faster?</h1>
<p>Moot as Python doesn't have a case statement. Talking about benchmarks
from other languages is pointless as what is faster in one language is
not always faster in another. Let's move on.</p>
<h1>The Significant Advantage of Python's Approach</h1>
<p>Every once in a while I walk into a scenario where Python's approach
just works better than a switch/case statement. This is when at runtime
I need to add or remove potential items from the mapping. When this
occurs, my years of practice of writing dictionary mappings and dispatch
methods pays off. I have insights now that I never had back in the day
when I relied on switch/case statements.</p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>To me, that Python forced me to accumulate lots of practical experience
with mappings is a blessing in disguise. The constraint of not having
switch/case statements allowed me to create approaches and ideas I may
not have developed with it.</p>
<p>Intentional or not, Python's lack of switch/case has been a social
construct that made me a better coder.</p>
<p>Enough so that I think this accidental social construct is a better
answer than the official one of 'Do this instead!'</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the first <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> event I've
watched the movement grow with a sense of of awe and inevitability.
There is something about it that is both contagious and powerful, and in
a very good way. This past weekend I had my first chance to attend one
of their events in Ensenada, Mexico.</p>
<p>This is what we saw. A room full of attendees with laser focus. The
coaches were clearly inspired by the dedication of the women who had
come to learn and grow.</p>

The Django Girls Ensenada organizers did a magnificent job of assembling
a wonderful day that touched lives. We were very impressed!
<p>The event had two sponsors, <a href="https://halaken.org">Hala Ken</a> and the <a href="https://tijuana.usconsulate.gov/">US
Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico</a>. They did
more than just sponsor, they were part of the effort of organizing and
running the event.</p>
<p>My co-author, co-presenter, co-everything wife AudreyR also blogged her
account of it: <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com2015/05/our-trip-to-djangogirls-ensenada-mexico.html">Our Trip to DjangoGirls Ensenada,

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/markup-language-faceoff-lists</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/markup-language-faceoff-lists"/>
        <updated>2015-05-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to talk about lists. Not for shopping, not the programming
data type, but the display of items in both unordered and ordered
fashion.</p>
<p><a href="/markup-language-faceoff-lists.html"><img src="/images/bullets.png" alt="Bullets faceoff"></a></p>
<p>Specifically this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item A</li>
<li>Item B
<ol>
<li>First Numbered Inner Item</li>
<li>Second Numbered Inner Item</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Item C</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, lists of bullets and numbers. This article explores some
of the different tools used by the programming world to render display
lists, specifically <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>reStructuredText</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and
<strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>If you view the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> source of this
web page, you'll find this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;ul class="simple">
  &#x3C;li>Item A&#x3C;/li>
  &#x3C;li>
    Item B
    &#x3C;ol class="arabic">
      &#x3C;li>First Numbered Inner Item&#x3C;/li>
      &#x3C;li>Second Numbered Inner Item&#x3C;/li>
    &#x3C;/ol>
  &#x3C;/li>
  &#x3C;li>Item C&#x3C;/li>
&#x3C;/ul>
</code></pre>
<p>Or more clearly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;ul class="simple">
  &#x3C;li>Item A&#x3C;/li>
  &#x3C;li>
    Item B
    &#x3C;ol class="arabic">
      &#x3C;li>First Numbered Inner Item&#x3C;/li>
      &#x3C;li>Second Numbered Inner Item&#x3C;/li>
    &#x3C;/ol>
  &#x3C;/li>
  &#x3C;li>Item C&#x3C;/li>
&#x3C;/ul>
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but is incredibly verbose. <strong>HTML</strong> requires closing tags on
every element (keep in mind browsers are not the same as
specifications). Working with lists in HTML becomes tedious quickly.
Which is why so many people use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> tools or mark up
languages like <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>, as it expedites
creation of lists (and many other things).</p>
<h1>reStructuredText</h1>
<p>This blog is written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a> and
transformed into <strong>HTML</strong>. Let's see the markup for this blog post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rest">* Item A
* Item B

  #. First Numbered Inner Item
  #. Second Numbered Inner Item

* Item C
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the extra lines between bullets and numbers? A behavior of
<strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that you have to put those in nested lists in
order to make things display correctly. Also, 2 spaces indentation
generates a different result than 4 spaces, the former creating
sub-bullets, the latter creating an indented block quote with bullets.
They are there to remove ambiguity.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I did not know this until the day after I wrote
this article. Since understanding these behaviors can be challenging,
myself and Eric Holscher of <a href="https://readthedocs.org">ReadTheDocs</a> fame
began a project last year to <a href="https://restructuredtext.readthedocs.org/">clearly index and
document</a> all the details of
<strong>reStructuredText</strong> from the user's point of view. Our plan was to
provide this as an adjunct to the <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/">formal
documentation</a> of
<strong>reStructuredText</strong>. Alas, time and work considerations got in the way.
If you want to help expand our effort, you can contribute at
<a href="https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext">https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to note about <strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that it's pretty much
Python only. Outside the Python world if you are writing plaintext
markup then odds are you are using <strong>Markdown</strong>.</p>
<h1>Markdown</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> does lists really
well. Terse and no weird quirks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">- Item A
- Item B
  1. First Numbered Inner Item
  1. Second Numbered Inner Item
- Item C
</code></pre>
<p>Another nice feature about <strong>Markdown</strong> is that it's in use everywhere.
GitHub, Stack Overflow, my favorite tablet writing app, and a lot more.</p>
<h1>Markdown vs. reStructuredText</h1>
<p>Why don't I switch from <strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>? Here are
my reasons against switching:</p>
<ol>
<li>Force of habit.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> requires it to display package
long descriptions nicely on Package pages.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)">Sphinx</a>
is based on it.</li>
<li><strong>reStructuredText</strong> has one concrete standard, with extensions that
people add. Markdown has many standards, which may or may not have
shared features.</li>
<li>I can use <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to help transform
<strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>LaTeX</h1>
<p>Finally, let's discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>.
While not a markup language it bears mentioning, and I'll explain why
later in this section.</p>
<p>Up to about 8-10 years ago <strong>LaTeX</strong> was used in a lot of technical
writing, including the Python core documentation. That ended with the
rise of mark up languages, relegating <strong>LaTeX</strong> to the world of
academics, mathematicians and computer scientists - anywhere complex
equations need to be specified.</p>
<p>LaTeX belongs in this article because it is so commonly used with
markup. In fact, as far as I can tell, in order to render
<strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> content into the PDF format, the
most common approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a script to transform the markup into <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX">XeTeX</a> to
render the <strong>LaTeX</strong> into PDF.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why the extra step? Why not just go directly from markup to PDF? Well,
the content in <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> have to be
formatted in order for them to be displayed, or they will just look like
plaintext markup. When they are converted to <strong>HTML</strong>, the browser does
the formatting for us. When they are translated to PDF, LaTeX is a very
common choice. That is because <strong>LaTeX</strong> isn't a markup language, but a
typesetting tool. Unlike <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> which are
designed for ease of use, <strong>LaTeX</strong> is designed to make documents look
good.</p>
<p>Here is how I define my sample list in <strong>LaTeX</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-latex">\begin{itemize}
    \item Item A
    \item Item A
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item First Numbered Inner Item
            \item Second Numbered Inner Item
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Item C
\end{itemize}
</code></pre>
<p>Halfway between the markup languages and HTML in verbosity, <strong>LaTeX</strong>
lists are of medium difficulty to write. If this example makes <strong>LaTeX</strong>
look easy, please realize that while lists are easy to understand, other
structures like <strong>LaTeX</strong>
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables">tables</a> can quickly get out
of hand. <strong>LaTeX</strong>'s reputation for being an arcane tool is a well
deserved one.</p>
<h1>Modifying Generated LaTeX</h1>
<p>Several book authors, including ourselves, have written books using
<strong>reStructuredText</strong> or <strong>Markdown</strong>, generated the <strong>LaTeX</strong>, then
modified the <strong>LaTeX</strong> before rendering the PDF. The approach is
seductive: You get the ease of a markup language combined with the
formatting precision of <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<p>Or do you?</p>
<p>The problem my wife and I have faced is that the combination of
<strong>LaTeX</strong> packages and tools we've assembled for ourselves to write
books like <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8">Two Scoops of
Django</a> is
very, very different than what is rendered via
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils">docutils</a>' <code>rst2latex</code> or
Sphinx <code>make latex</code>. We've tried to write migration scripts, but have
found that we end up spending too much of our time on formatting.
That's why we have stuck with hand-crafted artisan <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<p>That isn't to say it isn't possible. In fact, Matt Harrison has
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Introduction-Python-Testing-Harrison-ebook/dp/B00AY4VE8E/?tag=mlinar-20">released</a>
a number
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Learning-Iteration-Generators-Python/dp/1492333514/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mlinar-20">handsome</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-1-Foundations/dp/1475266413/ref=sr_1_2?tag=mlinar-20">Python</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-2-Intermediate/dp/149055095X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">books</a>
following this path (<strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>LaTeX</strong>). I'm certain
there are <strong>Markdown</strong> books that follow this path too.</p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>For better or for worse, lists of bullets and numbers are a foundation
of how we communicate via the written medium. They allow for terse
communication of ideas and thought, but that same terseness can mean we
skip over details. Interestingly enough, the very tools that we use to
create lists can color our ability and desire to use them.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year on April 1st <a href="/two-scoops-of-goblins.html">I wrote how the next Two Scoops Press book would
be about goblins</a>.
Naturally, many interpreted this as an April Fool's Day prank. Also
naturally, I didn't agree or disagree with this interpretation of my
blog post.</p>
<p><a href="/two-scoops-of-goblins.html"><img src="/images/two-scoops-of-goblins.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<p><em>Image from blog post last year</em></p>
<p>Well, it's time to unveil the the punchline, as it were, for last
year's April Fool's Day post. Are you ready for it? Here goes...</p>
<p>The punchline is that blog post wasn't a joke or prank. Indeed,
yesterday I released my first fiction book, a dark fantasy novel with
goblins in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/into-the-brambles-ebook/dp/B00VC5UQHO/?tag=the-brambles-20"><img src="/images/itb.png" alt="Into the Brambles Cover"></a></p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p><em>The world was ancient, scarred from a thousand wars between gods,
immortals, and heroes. Old grudges have faded but are not forgotten.</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of a so-called 'age of peace', two great nations of
immortals march against each other, with humanity caught in the middle.
In this world of conflict, three very different individuals are thrust
into the face of danger.</em></p>
<p><em>Here a young man is marched off to war, a noble woman takes charge of
her own destiny, and in the depths of the Haunted Lands a dark king is
born. Their fates will shake the foundations of the universe.</em></p>
<p>If you would like to buy my book, you can do so on
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/into-the-brambles-ebook/dp/B00VC5UQHO/?tag=the-brambles-20">Amazon</a>
for the introductory price of $2.99, the same price as a cup of coffee
in the USA. The book is also in the Kindle Unlimited program, at least
for now.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/phasing-out-django-packages-apiv1-apiv2</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/phasing-out-django-packages-apiv1-apiv2"/>
        <updated>2015-03-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is time to upgrade <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/">Django
Packages</a>. If you are using the site's
APIs in any way, this affects you.</p>
<p>This site, maintained by myself and <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy
Greenfeld</a>, is the directory of reusable
apps, sites, and tools for Django-powered projects. And the site has
been running on Django 1.4.x for about 2.5 years. Which in internet
years is forever. It's time to upgrade!</p>
<p>Alas, we have a problem.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The first REST API for the project, APIv1 is running on a very old
version of
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie/0.9.7">django-tastypie</a>
(0.9.7) which blocks upgrading the Django version, even to Django 1.5.
While we could do a lot of work to migrate upwards to modern
django-tastypie, that would require a lot of time that we would rather
spend adding new features or making other stuff. More importantly, there
are elements to the APIv1's design that we want to change.</p>
<p>While we are on the subject of legacy APIs, the second REST API for the
project, the mostly undocumented APIv2, is powered by a relatively old
version of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/2.3.8">Django Rest
Framework</a>
(2.3.8). The design of APIv2 was a bit of an experiement in
architectural design, one whose novel approach (API views mixed into
standard HTML views instead of seperated out) was unweildy and
ultimately annoying. One might even call it an anti-pattern. That's
fine, as sometimes you have to try things in order to determine better
approaches for later, but it's time for this version of the API to die.</p>
<p>Our eventual goal is to get Django Packages running on Django 1.8 as
well as implementing a brand-new REST API powered by Django Rest
Framework. Getting there is the trick. Hence, we've created "<strong>The
Plan</strong>".</p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>We have a four-stage plan for migrating the site upwards:</p>
<ol>
<li>On April 2, 2015 we will be turning off APIv1. All endpoints will
redirect to APIv3.</li>
<li>On April 3, 2015, we will be turning off APIv2. All endpoints will
stop working.</li>
<li>On April 4, we commence work on migrating the project to Django 1.8.</li>
<li>Whenever we finish #3, we start work on APIv4, powered by Django
Rest Framework.</li>
</ol>
<h3>About APIv3</h3>
<p>Already implemented, this version of the API is powered by very simple
JSON-powered views. Since both APIv1 and APIv2 only have GET endpoints,
it was easy to roll something out that provided nearly all the data
generated by both previous APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://djangopackages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/apiv3_docs.html">Django Packages APIv3
Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/api/v3/">Django Packages APIv3
Endpoint</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update 2014/03/01</strong>: Clarified the design mistake of APIv2.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators">decorators</a>.
I always have to look it up. Worse, I always have to remember where to

lose this reference: It's on my laptop and the internet.</p>
<p>Each type will include a basic version, a <code>functools.wraps</code> version, and

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/building-conda-packages-for-multiple-operating-systems"/>
        <updated>2015-01-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> project,
recently we added <a href="https://conda.pydata.org/">conda</a> to the open source
packaging systems we officially support (You can find Cookiecutter on
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter">PyPI</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/cookiecutter.rb">homebrew</a>,
and apparently some Linux distros).</p>
<h1>Creating a conda recipe from a PyPI package</h1>
<p>Prequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html#miniconda">conda binary</a>
installed.</li>
<li>A package deployed to
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter">PyPI</a> (in our case,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter/0.9.1">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter/0.9.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those are ready, create a conda recipe for Cookiecutter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ conda skeleton pypi cookiecutter
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a conda recipe, which is a directory named
<code>cookiecutter</code> that contains several text files.</p>
<p>Inside the new <code>cookiecutter</code> recipe directory, find the <code>meta.yaml</code>
file and change the appropriate sections to have this content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">source:
    # Change to match the most recent release
    git_tag: 0.9.1
    git_url: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.git

package:
    name: cookiecutter
    version: {{ environ['GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG'] }}

build:
    number: {{ environ.get('GIT_DESCRIBE_NUMBER', 0) }}

    # Note that this will override the default build string with the Python
    # and NumPy versions
    string: {{ environ.get('GIT_BUILD_STR', '') }}
</code></pre>
<h1>Building a conda package</h1>
<p>Use the conda recipe to build a package for my operating system (in this
case, Mac OS X):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ conda build cookiecutter
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a Cookiecutter conda package at
<code>~/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/cookiecutter-0.9.1_BUILDNUM.tar.bz2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The official conda recipe for <strong>cookiecutter</strong> is at
<a href="https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/tree/master/cookiecutter">https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/tree/master/cookiecutter</a>.</p>
<h1>Converting the conda package to other systems</h1>
<p>Let's convert that to Windows and Linux systems:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ conda convert ~/miniconda/conda-bld/osx-64/cookiecutter-0.9.1_BUILDNUM.tar.bz2 -p all
</code></pre>
<p>This creates five new directories, each with a new package. It looks
something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ls
linux-32
linux-64
osx-64
win-32
win-64
</code></pre>
<p>Each one of these directories contains a conda build also named
<code>cookiecutter-0.9.1_BUILDNUM.tar.bz2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I never left the Mac OSX operating system, yet I have packages
that are pretty much garaunteed to work on Windows and Linux. That said,
Cookiecutter is pure python and it's dependencies already have conda
packages. I haven't tried this yet on anything that includes compiling
C or C++, much less Fortran.</p>
<h1>Uploading conda packages to Binstar</h1>
<p>With these packages created, it's time to upload them to
<a href="https://binstar.org">binstar</a>, the primary conda package index.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://binstar.org/account/register">register your binstar
account</a>.</p>
<p>Then use conda to install the binstar client:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ conda install binstar
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, start uploading the new packages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ binstar upload linux-32/cookiecutter-0.9.1-BUILDNUM.tar.bz2
$ binstar upload linux-64/cookiecutter-0.9.1-BUILDNUM.tar.bz2
$ binstar upload osx-64/cookiecutter-0.9.1-BUILDNUM.tar.bz2
$ binstar upload win-32/cookiecutter-0.9.1-BUILDNUM.tar.bz2
$ binstar upload win-64/cookiecutter-0.9.1-BUILDNUM.tar.bz2
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://binstar.org/pydanny/cookiecutter">Check out the results of my
work</a> or take a look right
below at what's on <a href="https://binstar.org">binstar</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://binstar.org/search?q=cookiecutter"><img src="/images/packages.png" alt="image">{.align-center
width="500px"
height="138px"}</a></p>
<h1>Try installing Cookiecutter with conda!</h1>
<p>If you have <strong>conda</strong> installed, you should be able to get Cookiecutter
thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ conda config --add channels https://conda.binstar.org/pydanny
$ conda install cookiecutter
</code></pre>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Writing about how to package software is hard, so figuring this out was
a <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/issues/232#issuecomment-71552905">bit of detective
work</a>.
I think that's going to change, as the company behind conda, <a href="https://www.continuum.io/">Continuum
Analytics</a> has stated their intentions to
improve conda's documentation. Furthermore, just as many <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter#python">for-python
cookiecutter templates</a>
include carefully researched <code>setup.py</code> modules for use with
<code>distutils</code>, in 2015 I think we'll begin to see many of these templates
include carefully research conda recipes and instructions.</p>
<p>Many thanks go to <a href="https://twitter.com/fperez_org">Fernando Perez</a> for
inspiring me to actually delve into conda. <a href="https://twitter.com/tswicegood">Travis
Swicegood</a> gave me some useful pointers.
Last, but not least, none of this would have been figured out without
the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/westurner">Wes Turner</a>.</p>
<h1>Updates</h1>
<ul>
<li>2015/01/31 - Fixed a broken binstar link thanks to Russ Ferriday.</li>
<li>2015/01/30 - Wes Turner corrected a couple typos in the conda
command statements.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/setup.png" alt="Setup.py tricks"></p>
<p>Seasons greetings!</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want to make very clear that most of what I'm about
to explain are <strong>'tricks'</strong>. They aren't "best practices", and in
at least one case, is possibly inadvisable.</p>
<p>Speaking of inadvisable practices, at some point I'll write a
<strong>'setup.py traps'</strong> blog post, which are things I believe you should
never, ever do in a <strong>setup.py</strong> module.</p>
<h2>Tricks</h2>
<p>These are tricks I have to make package management in
<a href="https://python.org">python</a> a tiny bit easier. Before you attempt to
implement them, I recommend you have at least basic experience with
creating new packages. Two ways to learn about python packaging are the
<a href="https://audreyr.gitbooks.io/new-library-sprint/content/">New Library
Sprint</a>
(beginner friendly) and the <a href="https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org">Python Packaging User
Guide</a> (more
advanced).</p>
<h3>'python setup.py publish'</h3>
<p>This is where it all started. One day I was looking at some of <a href="https://github.com/tomchristie">Tom
Christie's code</a> and discovered the
<a href="https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/971578ca345c3d3bae7fd93b87c41d43483b6f05/setup.py#L61-L67">python setup.py
publish</a>
command inside the <strong>setup.py</strong> module of <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong>. It
goes something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># setup.py
import os
import sys

# I'll discuss version tricks in a future blog post.
version = "42.0.0"

if sys.argv[-1] == 'publish':
    os.system("python setup.py sdist upload")
    os.system("python setup.py bdist_wheel upload")
    print("You probably want to also tag the version now:")
    print("  git tag -a %s -m 'version %s'" % (version, version))
    print("  git push --tags")
    sys.exit()

# Below this point is the rest of the setup() function
</code></pre>
<p>What's awesome about this is that using this technique I don't have to
look up the somewhat cryptic <strong>python setup.py sdist upload</strong> command,
or the actually cryptic <strong>python setup.py bdist_wheel upload</strong>.
Instead, when it's time to push one of my packages to
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, I just type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python setup.py publish
</code></pre>
<p>Much easier to remember!</p>
<h3>'python setup.py tag'</h3>
<p>The problem with Tom Christie's <strong>python setup.py publish</strong> command is
that it forces me to type out the <strong>git tag</strong> command. Okay, let's be
honest, it forces me to copy/paste the output of my screen. Therefore,
all on my very own, I 'invented' the <strong>python setup.py tag</strong> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># setup.py

if sys.argv[-1] == 'tag':
    os.system("git tag -a %s -m 'version %s'" % (version, version))
    os.system("git push --tags")
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty nifty, eh? Now I don't have to remember so many cryptic git
commands. And I get to shorten the python setup.py publish command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if sys.argv[-1] == 'publish':
    os.system("python setup.py sdist upload")
    os.system("python setup.py bdist_wheel upload")
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>When I need to do a version release, I commit my code then type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python setup.py publish
$ python setup.py tag
</code></pre>
<p>Why don't I combine the commands? Well, you aren't supposed to put
things like 'RC1' or '-alpha' in your PyPI version names. By
seperating the commands I have finer grained control over my package
releases. I'm encouraged to place alpha, beta, and release candidates
in git tags, rather than formal PyPI releases.</p>
<h3>'python setup.py test'</h3>
<p>I'm fairly certain some of my readers are going to have a seriously
problem with this trick. In fact, depending on the the response of those
who manage Python's packaging infrastructure, it might be moved to my
forthcoming 'traps' blog post.</p>
<p>Alrighty then...</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://pytest.org">py.test</a>. I've <a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">blogged about the use of
py.test</a>. I
try to use it everywhere. Yet, I'm really not a fan of how we're
supposed tie it into <strong>python setup.py test</strong>. The precise moment I get
uncomfortable with <strong>py.test</strong> is when it makes me add special classes
into <strong>setup.py</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if sys.argv[-1] == 'test':
    test_requirements = [
        'pytest',
        'flake8',
        'coverage'
    ]
    try:
        modules = map(__import__, test_requirements)
    except ImportError as e:
        err_msg = e.message.replace("No module named ", "")
        msg = "%s is not installed. Install your test requirments." % err_msg
        raise ImportError(msg)
    os.system('py.test')
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>Which means I get to use <strong>py.test</strong> and <strong>python setup.py test</strong> with a
trivial addition of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python setup.py test
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, one could run <strong>pip install</strong> on the missing requirements, or
call them from a requirements file. However, since these are 'tricks',
I like to keep things short and sweet. If I get enough positive results
for this one I'll update this example to include calling of <strong>pip</strong> for
missing requirements.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: This doesn't mean I'm not using
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox">tox</a>. In fact, I use tox to call my
version of <strong>python setup.py test</strong>.</p>
<h2>What about subprocess?</h2>
<p>There are those who will ask, "Why aren't you using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html">subprocess</a> library
for these shell commands?"</p>
<p>My answer to that question is, "Because if I need a nuclear weapon to
kill a rabbit maybe I'm overdoing things." For these simple tricks,
the <strong>os.system()</strong> function is good enough.</p>
<h2>Why not just use a Makefile?</h2>
<p>While I code primarily on Mac OSX and Linux, most of my open source
packages are used Windows. Thanks to <a href="https://appveyor.com">AppVeyor</a>,
I'm testing more and more of them in that environment. In fact, I'll
probably be modifying these "tricks" to work better for Windows users.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>2014/12/21 - Added a note about using tox.</li>
<li>2014/12/21 - Added a note about Makefile and Windows</li>
</ul>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/homemade-pumpkin-puree</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/homemade-pumpkin-puree"/>
        <updated>2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I make the base for pies and other yummy concoctions.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm of the opinion that homemade pumpkin puree is better than what
comes out of a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farmers-Market-Organic-Pumpkin-15-Ounce/dp/B0062A87HA/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">can</a>.
Some people disagree with me, but I argue that the delicate, sensitive
flavor of pumpkin is easy to overwhelm. Simply put, if you overload it
with sugar and/or that mixture of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and
allspice called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culinary-Secrets-Pumpkin-Pie-Spice/dp/B00OGNFZA2/ref=sr_1_14?tag=mlinar-20">pumpkin
spice</a>,
canned is going to taste identical (if not better).</p>
<p>Before you belabor the point of homemade versus canned, the same
argument for overloading quality ingredients with sugar and spices can
be made for coffee, tea, flour, steak, etc.</p>
<p>In any case, homemade pumpkin puree is really easy to make. At home, my
<a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">wife</a> and I use it as the base for all our
pumpkin dishes.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 pie pumpkin</strong> <em>(You can substitute regular pumpkins, but pie
pumpkins are easier and taste better)</em></li>
<li><strong>1 tablespoon of olive oil</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>First, get out your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microban-Antimicrobial-Cutting-Board-Green/dp/B00BM9939C/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">cutting
board</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Fibrox-8-Inch-Chefs-Knife/dp/B000638D32/ref=zg_bs_289857_1?tag=mlinar-20">french
knife</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-uncut.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-uncut.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Cut the pumpkin in half. Don't worry about getting the halves perfectly
equal, it doesn't matter. What does matter is being careful with your
knife!</p>
<p>I start with the point of the knife, puncturing into the middle. Then I
carefully slice around the whole pumpkin, keeping the point in the
middle. It does take a little bit of effort, but so does carving a jack
o-lantern.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/slicing-pumpkin.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/slicing-pumpkin.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Once halved the pumpkin should look like the photo below. Note how the
edges aren't perfect!</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/halved-pumpkin.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/halved-pumpkin.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Set the over to 350 degrees fahrenheit, or about 176 degrees celsius.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/setting-oven.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/setting-oven.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Scoop out the seeds into a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iSi-Basics-Flexible-Silicone-Mixing/dp/B000S17WNO/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mlinar-20">mixing
bowl</a>.
You can use a spoon or your hand. Don't worry about getting the stringy
material out of the pumpkin. It's perfectly edible and provides a
slightly stronger pumpkin flavor when you are done.</p>
<p>In a future recipe I'll describe how you can roast the seeds.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/scoop-out-pumpkin.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/scoop-out-pumpkin.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Spread the spoonful of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/California-Olive-Ranch-Extra-Virgin/dp/B004ULUVU4/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">olive
oil</a>
on the parts of the halved pumpkin touched by the french knife. The goal
is to not have the pumpkin stick to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-Natural-Aluminum-Commercial/dp/B000G0KJG4/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">cookie
sheet</a>
while also not overwhelming the delicate flavor with olive oil.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/oiling-pumpkins.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/oiling-pumpkins.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Put the pumpkin halves face down on the cookie sheet then place that in
the oven.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/oven.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/oven.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>In about 45-60 minutes the pumpkins will be done. The skin of the
pumpkin should be a little darker and perhaps take on mottling.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/done-pumpkins.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/done-pumpkins.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Wait about 5-10 minutes for the pumpkin to cool. Then peel off all the
skin and throw it away. In the photo below you can see where I took the
stem of the pumpkin and just pulled off the skin. The little hole in the
pumpkin flesh itself is where we tested the flavor with a spoon (it was
yummy).</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/peeling-pumpkin.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/peeling-pumpkin.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Using a big spoon, scoop the cooked pumpkin into another mixing bowl. In
this case, we dumped it right into the soup pot. It will fall apart in
the process, but that's okay!</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/cooked-pumpkin.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/cooked-pumpkin.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Puree the pumpkin! We prefer the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HB-155PC-Blender-Blending-Attachments/dp/B00DOK0R2O/ref=sr_1_3?tag=mlinar-20">immersion
blender</a>
as it's less setup/cleanup than a food processer or blender. Not to
mention you can do it right in the soup pot.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-puree.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-puree.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Use the puree in something yummy! Here we used homemade pumpkin puree,
milk, chicken stock, and spices to make an healthy, savory pumpkin soup.
It's been dressed with a dab of sour cream and roasted pumpkin seeds.</p>
<p><a href="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-soup.jpg"><img src="/images/homemade-pumpkin-puree/pumpkin-soup.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>Yes, I'll be documenting our pumpkin soup recipe in a future blog post.
:-)</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/adding-django-form-instance-attributes</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/adding-django-form-instance-attributes"/>
        <updated>2014-09-15T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes in the <code>clean()</code>, <code>clean_FOO</code> or <code>save()</code> methods of a Django
form, you need to have additional form instance attributes available. A
sample case for this is having <code>user_id</code> available. This is a simple
example of how to do it in Class-Based Views.</p>
<p>Assuming this form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django import forms

from .models import MyModel


class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel

    def __init__(self, user_id, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # set the user_id as an attribute of the form
        self.user_id = user_id
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the form is defined, the view needs to inject the form with the
user id:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views.generic import UpdateView

# this assumes that django-braces is installed
from braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin

from .forms import MyForm
from .models import MyModel


class MyUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = MyModel
    form_class = MyForm
    success_url = "/someplace/"

    def get_form_kwargs(self):
        """This method is what injects forms with their keyword
            arguments."""
        # grab the current set of form #kwargs
        kwargs = super(MyUpdateView, self).get_form_kwargs()
        # Update the kwargs with the user_id
        kwargs['user_id'] = self.request.user.pk
        return kwargs
</code></pre>
<h1>Additional Notes</h1>
<p>You can use this technique with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>forms.Form</code></li>
<li><code>forms.ModelForm</code></li>
<li><code>CreateView</code></li>
<li><code>FormView</code></li>
<li><code>UpdateView</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, <a href="https://ccbv.co.uk">https://ccbv.co.uk</a> is a great resource for deliving into
Django forms.</p>
<p>While this technique is used by <code>django-braces</code> through the
<code>UserFormKwargsMixin</code> and <code>UserKwargModelFormMixin</code> mixins, it's useful
to know how to do it outside that very useful tool. The reason being
that attaching the <code>user</code> object or <code>user_id</code> is just one option out of
many.</p>
<h1>django-vanilla-views</h1>
<p>This should also work with
<a href="https://django-vanilla-views.org">django-vanilla-views</a>, but I haven't
tested it yet.</p>

<p>On October 4th and 5th I'll be at <a href="/barcamp-django-sf.html">BarCamp Django
SF</a> if you want to talk
about Django, Python, or have me teach you how to do cartwheels.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>BarCamp Django SF!</h2>
<p>On October 4th and 5th <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django
SF</a> will be taking place in the
<a href="https://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> office in San Francisco. <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp
Django SF</a> is a low-cost,
community-focused event that's different than any previous multi-day
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> conference.</p>
<p>How is <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a>
different than previous Django conferences and events?</p>
<h3>Speakers are determined at the event</h3>
<p>I know what you are thinking. It's something on the line of "<em>What the
heck?!?</em>"</p>
<p>It means that if you want to give a talk, you don't need to be an
expert. We don't have an formal, extensive review process. It's a
chance to share ideas and learn something new. You can be just a Django
hobbyist instead of a professional. All you have to be is
<strong>passionate</strong>.</p>
<p>At the event, we'll put up a board with slots for talks. Attendees can
put themselves into these slots for talks. This makes for a fun, fluid
event where new speakers are as welcome as experienced speakers.</p>
<p>While this is meant to be an informal, beginner-friendly event, a
professional level of conduct is still required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers, like all attendees must agree to the code of
conduct (listed on the <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">event page</a>).</li>
<li>No sales or recruiting pitches. Don't even try it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some attendees planning to be speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/simonw">Simon Willison</a> (co-founder of Django,
co-founder of <a href="https://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin">Andrew Godwin</a> (South,
Migrations, etc)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie Downe</a> (co-founder of
<a href="https://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a>)</li>
<li><a href="audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a>
(<a href="github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/messagebar">MessageBar</a>, <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6">Two Scoops of
Django</a>)</li>
<li>Michael Herman (<a href="https://twitter.com/realpython">Real Python</a>)</li>
<li>Myself</li>
<li>You! We especially welcome people from diverse backgrounds (race,
gender, age, LGBT, disability, nationality, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>note:</strong> Since enough people asked me about it, <strong>speaking is not
mandatory</strong> for attendees of BarCamp Django SF.</p>
<h3>BarCamp Django are just $15</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly, tickets for this event are just <strong>$15</strong>.
All proceeds from ticket sales are going to the Django Software
Foundation.</p>
<p>What that <strong>$15</strong> gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meals and snacks.</li>
<li>A chance to share ideas, learn something new, and network with
peers.</li>
<li>A big speaking room and over 10 smaller rooms for breakout sessions.</li>
<li>Security, including enforcement of the code of conduct.</li>
<li>Camping! (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Camping!</h3>
<p>On the night of October 4th, you can stay overnight at <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django
SF</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> is 2 days,
and will run from 10am Saturday morning until 4pm Sunday in the
<a href="https://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> San Francisco office. Doors will be
open throughout the duration of the event and all are welcome to camp
out overnight. If you do plan on camping, you'll need to <strong>bring your
own sleeping bag, blow up beds, pillows &#x26; blankets</strong>.</p>
<p>What's really awesome about camping at <a href="https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django
SF</a> is it allows out-of-town
attendees to keep their costs low ($15 event cost vs $200+ hotel
rooms).</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> Our definition of 'camping' is staying overnight inside the
Eventbrite office in San Francisco. While you can't pitch a tent, you
don't have to worry about mosquitoes. Some people will stay up all
night, but we'll have quiet areas for those of us who need our 8 hours.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014/09/13:</strong> Added note that explains speaking is not
mandatory.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'll be arriving in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina">Argentina</a>
on August 14th. I'll be speaking at <a href="https://eventioz.com.ar/e/pyday-mendoza-2014">PyDay
Mendoza</a> on August 15th,
and sprinting on August 16th on something
<a href="audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a> and I named the "new library
sprint" (more details to come). On August 22nd, I'll be speaking at
the combined Buenos Aires Python, Django, and PyLadies Argentina meetup.
Between the events I'll be working from the
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>/<a href="https://eventioz.com.ar">Eventioz</a>
Argentina office.</p>
<p>I'm extremely excited. I've wanted to go to Argentina for years. It's
a beautiful country filled with magnificent culture, lovely
architecture, great food, superb wine, and wonderful people. Speaking of
which, I can't wait to finally put faces to people I've gotten to know
over the internet.</p>
<p>Hasta pronto!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Join me, <a href="https://www.aeracode.org/">Andrew Godwin</a> (South, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/">Django
migrations</a>),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Willison">Simon</a>
<a href="https://blog.simonwillison.net/">Willison</a> (co-founder of
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>, co-founder of
<a href="https://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a>), and many other talented people at
<a href="https://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a>. We have great challenges, the kind
that inspire you to rise to the occasion. We need you to help us
overcome them.</p>
<p>I should mention that Eventbrite is committed to giving back to the
community. Most notably <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3/posts/921581">Eventbrite just contributed £5000 to the Django
Rest Framework
kickstarter</a>,
or about <strong>US$8500!!</strong> We're a frequent sponsor of events around the
world. It doesn't stop there, as Eventbrite managers during the
discussion of any tool outside our domain of running events will ask:
"<em>When can we open source this?</em>"</p>
<p>As someone who loves working on open source, Eventbrite is the place to
be. I say this because I know what we're planning to do in the future.
If you join us, you'll find out sooner rather than later. ;)</p>
<p>What's Eventbrite like as a company? Well, we're rated in the <strong>top 20
of best places to work</strong> in the United States. We get full benefits,
free lunch, educational opportunities, and much more. In addition, I
have to say that my co-workers are friendly, intelligent, always
learning, and love to do things the right way, even if it's the hard
way.</p>
<h1>Applying for Eventbrite Python positions</h1>
<p>Sure, you could go to the official Eventbrite job site, but this method
is a fun challenge that proves to us you have the basics down. All you
need to do is pass this little test of mine. If you fail any portion of
this test we can't consider hiring you.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can you work</strong> in <strong>San Francisco</strong> (USA), <strong>Nashville</strong> (USA), or
<strong>Mendoza</strong> (Argentina)?</li>
<li><strong>Do you know Python?</strong> Sorry, we aren't looking for Foxpro coders.
Experience with git-scm, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and MySQL definite
pluses.</li>
<li><strong>Are you able to communicate in both written and verbal English?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are you a coder?</strong> I will throw away anything from a recruiter.</li>
<li><strong>Can you figure out how to contact me?</strong> Eventbrite doesn't
believe in testing applicants with puzzle logic questions. Instead,
we ask you meaningful technical questions or to solve a coding
problem. With that in mind, use the following to contact me:</li>
</ol>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/cached-property</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/cached-property"/>
        <updated>2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Python, the <code>@cached_property</code> decorator is a really nice piece of
code. What it does is it caches the result of a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property">property</a>
call. The cached result will persist as long as the instance does, so if
the instance is passed around and the function subsequently invoked, the
cached result will be returned.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make much sense, below is a snippet of code that shows
the code and demonstrates it in action. As always, I'm using
<a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">pytest</a> to
validate my code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import time

class cached_property(object):
    """ A property that is only computed once per instance and then replaces
        itself with an ordinary attribute. Deleting the attribute resets the
        property.

        Source: https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/commit/fa7733e075da0d790d809aa3d2f53071897e6f76
        """

    def __init__(self, func):
        self.__doc__ = getattr(func, '__doc__')
        self.func = func

    def __get__(self, obj, cls):
        if obj is None:
            return self
        value = obj.__dict__[self.func.__name__] = self.func(obj)
        return value

class SlowClass1(object):

    @cached_property
    def very_slow(self):
        """Represents a performance heavy property."""
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait a WHOLE second!
        return "I am slooooow"

def test_slow_class1():
    # Instantiate the slow class
    slow_class = SlowClass1()

    # Start the clock!
    start = datetime.now()

    # Call the property. This time it's really slow...
    assert slow_class.very_slow == "I am slooooow"

    # Check that it took at least a second to run
    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1000) >= start - datetime.now()

    # Call the property a second time. This time it runs fast.
    assert slow_class.very_slow == "I am slooooow"

    # Second time running, should take a TINY amount of time.
    # Should take just a microsecond, but we'll play a test for and test
    #   for a maximim of at least 100 milliseconds.
    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1100) > start - datetime.now()
</code></pre>
<p>This is great for encapsulating slow database queries, fetching results
from third-party REST APIs, performing slow algorithms, and anything
else where you would want to catch the results. Pretty neat, yeah!</p>
<p>While originally implemented for web frameworks such as Django, Flask,
Pyramid, and Bottle, I've copy/pasted the <code>cached_property</code> property
from non-web project to project as a quick way to give my code a little
boost. I got tired of doing this, and on May 17th, 2014 I decided to
release it as a package called cached-property on
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cached-property">PyPI</a>. Using it is easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># assuming you've already done "pip install cached-property"
from cached_property import cached_property

class SlowClass2(object):

    @cached_property
    def very_slow(self):
        """Represents a performance heavy property."""
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait a WHOLE second!
        return "I am slooooow"

def test_slow_class2():
    # Instantiate the slow class
    slow_class = SlowClass2()

    # Start the clock!
    start = datetime.now()

    # Call the property. This time it's really slow...
    assert slow_class.very_slow == "I am slooooow"

    # Check that it took at least a second to run
    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1000) >= start - datetime.now()

    # Call the property a second time. This time it runs fast.
    assert slow_class.very_slow == "I am slooooow"

    # Second time running, should take a TINY amount of time.
    # Should take just a microsecond, but we'll play a test for and test
    #   for a maximim of at least 100 milliseconds.
    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1100) > start - datetime.now()
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! No more copy/pasting for me! I was very pleased with myself.</p>
<p>Little did I know how fortunate I was for having released this package.</p>
<h1>Don't Copy/Paste Code</h1>
<p>The very next day after I released the cached-property package, <a href="https://github.com/Tinche">Tin
Tvrtković</a> opened an issue asking for <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/issues/6">better
multithreaded
support</a>. To my
shock and embarressment, my copy/pasted code could have been disastrous
if brought into the wrong project. I had blindly been assuming that the
code I hadn't bothered to try and understand worked under any
situation, when in reality it had been designed for working within the
context of a web framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Tin <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/pull/9">submitted a pull
request</a>, and now the
<code>cached-property</code> package also includes a <code>@threaded_cached_property</code>
decorator. Thank you Tin!</p>
<p>However, the lessons of the experience had been burned into my brain.</p>
<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don't copy/paste code blindly from project to project.</li>
<li>If you are repeatedly moving code from project to project, take the
time to understand what the code is actually doing.</li>
<li>Instead of copy/pasting code from project to project, make a package
and ask for input from others. If making a package feels like too
much work,
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>
makes creating new packages really easy.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Going forward</h1>
<p>One exciting development has been the <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/issues/2">discussion to include a
cached_property decorator in core
Python</a>. Even if my
contribution to the effort has been merely the encapsulation of the
code, it's nice to know I may have some small part in the development
of the language.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/jinja2-quick-load-function</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/jinja2-quick-load-function"/>
        <updated>2014-06-12T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like that for every few weeks I find myself needing to generate
something out of a template while working outside a framework. For this
task, my preferred solution is <a href="https://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>. I've
used Jinja2 to generate HTML, code, and text. If I were brave enough I
would even say I've used it to generate XML (<em>While my preferred xml
tool is great for parsing, even lxml is not so much fun for XML
generation</em>).</p>
<p>I frequently use this snippet of code to render templates. Since I'm
tired of digging through my code to find it, I'm placing it here for
personal reference.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from jinja2 import FileSystemLoader, Environment

def render_from_template(directory, template_name, **kwargs):
    loader = FileSystemLoader(directory)
    env = Environment(loader=loader)
    template = env.get_template(template_name)
    return template.render(**kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from simple_script import render_from_template
>>> data = {
...     "date": "June 12, 2014",

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-partials-are-fun</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-partials-are-fun"/>
        <updated>2014-04-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing reusable code is a good thing, right? The trick is to do so in a
way that makes your life and those of others easier, but to do so in a
very clear and maintainable way. Recently I've been playing around with
Python's
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functools.html#functools.partial">functools.partial</a>
function, which I've found can help facilitate writing reusable code.</p>
<p><a href="/python-partials-are-fun.html"><img src="/images/partials.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>While the documentation has a nice explanation and demonstration of
<code>functools.partial</code>, it's very serious. I've got my own internal
version of things which I think is a little more fun.</p>
<h1>My Explanation of <code>functools.partial</code></h1>
<p>What <code>functools.partial</code> does is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes a new version of a function with one or more arguments already
filled in.</li>
<li>New version of a function documents itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than dive into paragraphs of explanation, I'll use code examples
to explain how this works.</p>
<h1>My Demonstration of <code>functools.partial</code></h1>
<p>First, let's say we want to create a function that explicitly performs
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation">exponentiation</a>. This way
we can get the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra)">squares</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(algebra)">cubes</a>, and other power
operations on any number. This duplicates Python's built-in <code>pow()</code>
function, but our version has the very nice addition of keyword
arguments.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** exponent
</code></pre>
<p>Now what if we want to have dedicated square and cube functions that
leverage the <code>power()</code> function? Of course, we can do it thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def square(base):
    return power(base, 2)

def cube(base):
    return power(base, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but what if we want to create 15 or 20 variations of our
<code>power()</code> function? What about 1000 of them? Writing that much
repetitive code is, needless to say, annoying. This is where partials
come into play. Let's rewrite our square and cube functions using
partials, and test it for success using
<a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">py.test</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from functools import partial

square = partial(power, exponent=2)
cube = partial(power, exponent=3)

def test_partials():
    assert square(2) == 4
    assert cube(2) == 8
</code></pre>
<p>Whoa! That's awesome. You know what adds to that awesome? Functions
created with partial document themselves (to a degree). I'll
demonstrate with more tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_partial_docs():
    assert square.keywords == {"exponent": 2}
    assert square.func == power

    assert cube.keywords == {"exponent": 3}
    assert cube.func == power
</code></pre>
<p>Using a loop, let's build and test ten (10) custom <code>power()</code> functions,
which I'll call 'power partials' (ahem... I find 'power partials'
sounds rather amusing.):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_power_partials():

    # List to store the partials
    power_partials = []
    for x in range(1, 11):

        # create the partial
        f = partial(power, exponent=x)

        # Add the partial to the list
        power_partials.append(f)

    # We could just use list comprehension instead of the loop
    # [partial(power, exponent=x) for x in range(1, 11)]


    # Test the first power
    assert power_partials[0](2) == 2

    # Test the fifth power
    assert power_partials[4](2) == 32

    # Test the tenth power
    assert power_partials[9](2) == 1024        
</code></pre>
<h1>A Way to Organize Partials</h1>
<p>Lists are great, but sometimes it's nice to have a more legible way of
interacting with functions. There are an infinite ways to make this
happen, but I like the dot notation of classes. So here is a 'partial
structure' class which follows a pattern I think is pretty handy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Since I like my article code to work in both Python 2.7 and 3,
#   I'll import the excellent six library to manage the
#   differences between Python versions. Six is available on PyPI
#   at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six.
from six import add_metaclass

class PowerMeta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):

        # generate 50 partial power functions:
        for x in range(1, 51):

            # Set the partials to the class
            setattr(
                # cls represents the class
                cls,

                # name the partial
                "p{}".format(x),

                # partials created here
                partial(power, exponent=x)
            )
        super(PowerMeta, cls).__init__(name, bases, dct)

@add_metaclass(PowerMeta)
class PowerStructure(object):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, let's test our PowerStructure class as an instantiated
PowerStructure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_power_structure_object():
    p = PowerStructure()

    # 10 squared
    assert p.p2(10) == 100

    # 2 to the 5th power
    assert p.p5(2) == 32

    # 2 to the 50th power
    assert p.p50(2) == 1125899906842624
</code></pre>
<p>Looks good, right? But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of metaclasses, we don't need to instantiate the
PowerStructure class!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_power_structure_class():
    # Thanks to the power of metaclasses, we don't need to instantiate!

    # 10 squared
    assert PowerStructure.p2(10) == 100

    # 2 to the 5th power
    assert PowerStructure.p5(2) == 32

    # 2 to the 50th power
    assert PowerStructure.p50(2) == 1125899906842624
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/pydanny/11295815">Source Code</a></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I've provided some simple examples of how to use <code>functools.partials</code>.
I find them really useful for certain tasks, mostly in avoiding
repeating myself. Like any coding tool, complex usage can cloak the
meaning of code, so be careful and use <code>functools.partials</code> judiciously.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev">Nick Coghlan</a> reminded me to
mention that Python has a <code>pow()</code> built-in.</p>
<p>Update 04/30/2014: <a href="https://twitter.com/samueljohn_de">Samuel John</a>
corrected me on Nick Coghlan's name.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2014</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2014"/>
        <updated>2014-04-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>note</strong>: This post has been updated for PyCon 2015. Even though the URL
is old, the content is new.</p>
<p>New to Python and/or conferences and attending the upcoming <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon
2015</a> in Montreal, Canada? Or is this your
first conference? Or perhaps your first conference longer than a
weekend?</p>
<p>Hoping to get the most out of joining thousands of Python enthusiasts?</p>
<p>No worries! This guide will aid you in attending one of the best
technical conferences on the planet. Even though I'm not attending on
account of various reasons including finances, work, and personal
projects, I'm going to share how to get through duration of pycon in
good shape. I'm also going to share some great tricks to optimize the
event.</p>
<h1>Basics</h1>
<ol>
<li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>
<li>Bring something to take notes. A paper notebook, laptop, or tablet.
Anything!</li>
<li>If you are looking for work, bring business cards. Seriously.</li>
<li>At every meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) make a point of sitting
with or going out with different people. Introduce yourself. Make
new friends and learn new things!</li>
<li>If you can't make it to a talk, don't stress out. They are
recorded and will be available later on <a href="https://www.pyvideo.org">https://www.pyvideo.org</a>.</li>
<li>Act Professionally (see next section)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Be Professional</h1>
<p>PyCon is a professional event. Sure, lots of people are in t-shirts and
are having fun, often in oddly goofy ways. Yet stepping outside the
boundaries of civilized behavior is not acceptable. Keep in mind that
PyCon US has a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/">code of
conduct</a>. Whether or
not you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one
and it will be enforced.</p>
<h1>Get to the Registration Desk Early</h1>
<p>As the lines for registration can get epic, I like to get my badge as
early as possible so I don't miss PyCon's famously incredible keynote
speeches.</p>
<h1>Must-See Tutorials</h1>
<p>All of the beginner tutorials at
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/</a> look wonderful. You
simply can't go wrong with any of them.</p>
<h1>Must-See Talks</h1>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>I'm actually a little relieved that I'm not going to PyCon, because
there were some time slots thad several must-see talks running
concurrently. I would have to clone myself repeatedly in order to see
all the good stuff! Fortunately, I'll be able to watch them on
<a href="https://www.pyvideo.org">https://www.pyvideo.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are new to open source and plan to attend the PyCon 2015 sprints
(or in general contribute to open source), then I strongly recommend
Shauna Gordon-McKeon's "Open Source for Newcomers and the People Who
Want to Welcome Them" talk (description at
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/</a>). She's the
program director of Open Hatch, a group focused on bringing more people
into the open source community.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: For the talks you are excited about attending, get there
early. If you really want to attend a particular talk, odds are so does
everyone else and the room might be packed. Don't be forced to sit on
the floor or stand outside the door. Show up early!</p>
<p>See <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/</a> for the talk schedules.</p>
<h1>Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>
<p>At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and
brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some
quick guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions at the
end, <a href="https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/">go and
ask</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's disconcerting to
give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable
electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using
electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning
them off to look at the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of
hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video.
Heckling is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and
make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the
talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Lunches</h1>
<p>Don't forget to keep whatever they hand out to track meals at the
registration desk or you might not be able to get your food.</p>
<p>Try and sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every
time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to
meet amazing people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never
get to know any of them unless you try.</p>
<h1>Sprints</h1>
<p>When the tutorials and talks are over, the sprints begin. These are like
hackathons, but for only open source efforts. Imagine the chance to
apply everything you just learn, while sitting amongst other Python
enthusiast including dozens of projects leaders. Not only do you get the
chance to apply what you've just learned, you can contribute to make
the world of Python better!</p>
<p>See <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/">https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/</a> for general sprint
information.</p>
<h2>Sprint Requirements</h2>
<p>For beginners setting up a Python development environment can be tricky.
If the list below looks intimidating, look for any sprints with
"beginner" in the title. There is always something! While they aren't
listed yet, but there should be something up within a week or two.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want a pre-PyCon challenge, I recommend
getting the the following installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modern versions of Python:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.7 (mandatory)</li>
<li>Python 3.4 (Rather mandatory for Python 3 work)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be ready with source control. You should have installed and possess
working knowledge with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Git. Really make sure you have a GitHub account</li>
<li>Mercurial. Useful to have a BitBucket account.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html">virtualenv</a> and
<a href="https://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html">pip</a> for
all versions of Python. If you are using Python 3.4, you don't need
to have them installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An IDE or Text Editor you are comfortable using.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Staying Healthy Over Nine Days of Python!</h1>
<p>If you attend the tutorials, talks and sprints, that's <strong>nine days</strong>.
You (or your organization) are putting out some serious money for you to
go and discover new knowledge, new people, or a bunch of other reasons.
The last thing you want to do is end up sick for part or all of the
conference.</p>
<p>Odds are you'll be riding in public transit (planes, trains, buses) to
get there. Unfortunately, you'll be travelling with people who are
sick. Then, for over a week, you'll be around thousands of people who
have travelled under similar conditions. Many of those people, possibly
yourself, will be eating poorly, drinking heavily, and not getting
enough sleep.</p>
<p>Here are some things I've found work wonders to keep me active and
alert and I recommend you do the same <strong>every</strong> day of the conference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>
<li>Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different
people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!</li>
<li>Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your
brain is going to go into learning overdrive. I aim for 6-8 hours.</li>
<li>Bring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Airborne-Support-Supplement-Vitamin-Effervescent/dp/B000WZI4WY?tag=mlinar-20">Immune System
Boosters</a>
and consume them daily. I usually do it with breakfast and lunch.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Get Autographs!</h1>
<p>As an author, I can't recommend enough that you bring your favorite
programming book and get it autographed. A few books I want to get
signed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449340377/?tag=cn-001-20">Python Cookbook, by David Beazley and Brian
Jones</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793/?tag=cn-001-20">Python for Data Analysis, by Wes
McKinney</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications/dp/1449372627/?tag=cn-001-20">Flask Web Development, by Miguel
Grinberg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Harry-Percival/dp/1449364829/?tag=cn-001-20">Test-Driven Development with Python, by Harry
Percival</a></li>
</ul>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/surgery-in-two-days</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/surgery-in-two-days"/>
        <updated>2014-04-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In two days, Friday, April 4th, I'm going into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery">laparoscopic
surgery</a> in order to
correct a double inguinal hernia. If you want to know what that is, you
can read the Not Safe For Work (NSFW) Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>I said it.</p>
<p>I have a hernia.</p>
<p>That was hard.</p>
<p>It's one thing to admit you are sick or have an injury, but it's
another thing to admit you have a lower abdominal injury caused by
lifting too much. Even if 27% of men get it in their lifetime, it's
still hard to admit.</p>
<h1>How Did I Get A Hernia?</h1>
<p>Genetic predisposition, not to mention moving a refrigerator. And a
sofa. And much more.</p>
<p>Last year in early April my wife and were given the <a href="/off-to-europe.html">chance to work in
Europe</a> for a while. We moved
out of our place and put all our stuff into storage. We don't have that
much stuff, so we decided to do all the packing and moving ourselves.
While I hadn't worked out consistently in a couple of months, I <em>knew</em>
I was up for any heavy lifting.</p>
<p>In fact, for all my adult life every once in a while I either moved or
helped friends move their stuff. I'm in pretty good shape, have
endurance, and know how to lift. I'm really flexible too, able to get
low and push up.</p>
<p>For several days Audrey and I packed and moved stuff into the storage
facility. It was hard, sweaty work and we were racing to meet a
deadline. I didn't mind the work or pace at all. For me it's fun to do
hard labor for short periods and this was a blast. I also love pushing
myself physically.</p>
<p>Let's review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had to move lots of stuff in a few days.</li>
<li>Stuff was not gym-style weights, but awkward boxes and furniture.
Some of it heavy.</li>
<li>Love to push myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>We got it done just in time! Hooray! I was achey and sore, but really
proud of what we did. Something didn't feel quite right <em>down there</em>. I
shrugged it off.</p>
<h1>Something is Wrong</h1>
<p>On the way to Europe I realized something was wrong. I thought it would
go away, especially with good food and exercise. During the journey and
once we arrived, I tried working out, but afterwards I would be in more
discomfort.</p>
<p>No matter. We worked long, hard hours and spent the weekends
sightseeing. It was awesome. We met lots of our online friends. We
attended amazing conferences and events. It was incredible, and I pray I
get to do it again.</p>
<p>Except that all that walking and standing ached. Over a few hours that
ache would turn to pain. I thought it would go away, but it didn't.
Over time it hurt more and more. Often, out with friends, I pleaded
exhaustion. We kept going home early. Actually, I was just in a lot of
pain that I didn't understand.</p>
<p>My pride meant I didn't want to admit I was hurt.</p>
<h1>Admitting the Problem and Diagnosis</h1>
<p>On one of our last days in Zagreb, Croatia we took a very long walk. Far
from our lodging the discomfort got so bad that I sat on the ground.
Getting home was a nightmare. That was when we realized something was
really wrong.</p>
<p>We decided to keep walking to a minimum after that. We readied for our
next stop, the beachside city of Split in Croatia.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Split we did a little research and discovered that I
probably had a hernia. We went to a physician, and he confirmed it. He
had me see a surgeon, who confirmed it as well. While he suggested
surgery, he also let us know that just then wasn't a good time - there
was a threat of a nurses' strike in Croatia.</p>
<p>We decided to wait until we got back to the USA and the Affordable Care
Act went into effect. I could wait that long if I was careful abut
exercise and wore a brace. It sucked, because I would have to wait or
pay completely out of pocket.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Waiting was necessary because I didn't want to spend all my earnings
for a time feeding the heartless American insurance bureaucracy
industry.</p>
<p>As soon as it was available we signed up for proper American medical
coverage through the Affordable Care Act. I now have medical coverage! I
went through the necessary appointments and was recommended the surgery
that's going to happen in two days. The operation should take 90
minutes and I'm going home the same day. Two weeks after surgery I'll
be feeling completely normal, and a month after surgery I can carefully
restart my exercise regimen.</p>
<h1>Living With a Hernia</h1>
<p>It's doable but I don't recommend it.</p>
<p>If I walk or exercise, then I have to wear a brace. That brace gets
uncomfortable the longer I wear it, but it's better than the
alternative. It's risky for me to max out my weights unless I'm on a
machine. I can't do any direct abdominal exercises.</p>
<p>Without the brace I'm not supposed to lift anything heavier than 15
pounds. Ugh.</p>
<h1>The Part I Really Don't Like</h1>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>Logically I know it's a low risk operation done millions of times a
year around the world. That my surgeon is rated extremely well. Still,
it's me going under general anesthesia so a really nice lady can cut
holes in me.</p>
<p>So I'm scared.</p>
<p>I try not to think about it, the same way I ignored the injury during
most of my time in Europe. So far it's been working pretty well, except
when I'm driving or trying to sleep.</p>
<h1>PyCon in Montreal</h1>
<p>We're not going. We weren't going because of finances, work, etc., but
the scheduled surgery cemented it.</p>
<h1>Wish Me Luck!</h1>
<p>I can't wait for this to be done and finished. I want to be able to do
things again. To walk and run for hours with no more discomfort than
aching feet. To be able to pick things up.</p>
<p>It's going to be delightful.</p>
<p>One more thing: next time I'm hiring movers.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a> and I were
contemplating our next Two Scoops Press book topic, it came down to a
decision between Pyramid, Flask, and mythical creatures. Inspired by
Django's magical flying pony, Pyramid's scary alien dude, and even the
idea of a magical Flask pouring out wonderful projects, we've decided
to go with mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Specifically, we're writing about goblins, hence the title of this blog
post.</p>
<p>What that means is that the next book we publish will be fantasy. Going
forward all the books we write will be fiction.</p>
<p>If we ever write a new <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">Two Scoops of
Django</a>
book, it will be a fantasy about a magical flying pony who eats ice
cream. That way we'll confuse the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&#x26;field-keywords=django&#x26;tag=mlinar-20">already muddled Amazon.com search

'Django'</a>
even more.</p>

        <updated>2014-03-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago today <a href="https://about.me/malcolmt">Malcolm Tredinnick</a>, core
contributor to Django suddenly passed away. He was a mentor, and more
importantly, a good friend.</p>
<p>Here are some of my memories of Malcolm.</p>
<h1>DjangoCon US: September 2010</h1>
<p>This is where Audrey and I first met Malcolm. We ended up spending a
good amount of the conference with him just hanging out and having a
good time. I remember being honored that such a luminary wanted to spend
time with us, yet was more delighted in discovering a good friend.</p>
<p>During the conference, he peered into the nascent code base of
<a href="https://www.djangopackages.com">djangopackages.com</a> and asked some
pointed questions. We justified a few design decisions, and he agreed,
and we saw him using similar techniques later. He gave us some great
pointers on things we could do, and I believe we implemented all of
them.</p>
<h1>Summer to Autumn of 2010</h1>
<p>Malcolm and I worked together on a project in 2010. During this time we
had a number of email and chat discussions. Going over them now I'm
impressed by his friendship and generosity of knowledge. I know he was
terribly busy but yet he always had time for me in 2010.</p>
<p>After about 15 emails where I addressed him as 'Malcom', Malcolm
finally got me to consistently spell his name correctly with a single
sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might be amazed at how cranky it makes me when people try to spell
Malcolm with only one "l".</p>
<p>:-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was Malcolm: Acerbic yet tempered with a smile.</p>
<h1>PyCon Australia: August 2011</h1>
<p>We had just arrived in Sydney. Our first overseas trip together! Audrey
was giving the opening keynote at PyCon Australia. She wanted to
practice her speech but I was restless. So she suggested that I go out
for dinner, specifically sushi train with Malcolm Tredinnick and Russell
Keith-Magee. I don't remember anything about the food, but I do
remember having a great time with good friends.</p>
<p>After the conference one evening Audrey and I spent a few hours with
just Malcolm walking around Sydney. None of us wanted it to end. The
time spent together outside of the insane pace of a conference was a
poignant reminder that even with email, chat, and IRC, there was still
thousands of miles between us.</p>
<h1>PyCon Philippines: June 2012</h1>
<p>On his own dollar, Malcolm had dropped everything to attend. He spoke,
he taught, and he made many friends. I have to admit being jealous of
the students in the Django tutorial he taught because they got to spend
time with him. ;)</p>
<p>It was our last time with Malcolm, and it was so brief, so limited. I
was okay with that because I thought I would get a chance to see him
again.</p>
<h1>Two Scoops of Django: October 2012-January 2013</h1>
<p>If you read the
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/malcolm-tredinnick-memorial">memorial</a>
we wrote for Malcolm, you can see that his presence is an integral part
of Two Scoops of Django. He coached us, guided us, forced us to dig
deeper and deeper into source code. Of special note is the database
chapter (excluding the 1.6 edition transactions), which he really
focused on.</p>
<h1>Today: March 17th, 2014</h1>
<p>What Matt Croydon says:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Celebrate the life of <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt">@malcolmt</a> today: be nice to someone, help someone learn something, and push some code. Tomorrow: repeat.</p>&mdash; Matt Croydon (@mc) <a href="https://twitter.com/mc/statuses/314013575406571520">March 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/docstrings-and-various-python-objects</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/docstrings-and-various-python-objects"/>
        <updated>2014-03-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early in my journeys with Python I struggled with understanding the
purpose and use of <strong>lambda</strong> functions. When I finally understood them
I was disappointed by their lack of <strong>docstrings</strong>. For that reason, and
various other shortcomings, <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/07/lambdas-no-more.html">I went back to standard
functions</a>.
Also, for what it's worth, I've even spoken about how <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/python-worst-practices/41">you shouldn't
use
lambdas</a>.</p>
<p>Recently I was thinking about how everything in Python is an object.
This includes lambdas. Since all Python objects have the <code>__doc__</code>
special (aka 'magic') attribute, can we add custom docstrings to
everything?</p>
<p>Using <a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">pytest</a>,
Python 2.7.x, and lambdas, let's find out!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_docstrings.py
import pytest

def test_lambdas():
    # Create a lambda and test it
    doubler = lambda x: " ".join([x, x])
    assert doubler("fun") == "fun fun"

    # Add a docstring to the lambda
    doubler.__doc__ = "Doubles strings"

    # Test that calling __doc__ works
    assert doubler.__doc__ == "Doubles strings"
</code></pre>
<p>Hey! It worked! If I try it in the shell, I can even see that the
<code>help()</code> function works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> # Welcome to the REPL!
>>> doubler = lambda x: " ".join([x, x])
>>> doubler.__doc__ = "Doubles strings"
>>> help(doubler)
Help on function &#x3C;lambda> in module __main__:

&#x3C;lambda> lambda x
    Doubles strings
</code></pre>
<p>Contrary to what I thought in 2007, Python lambdas <em>can</em> be documented.
Modifying their docstring functions with both the direct <code>__doc___</code>
special attribute and the <code>help()</code> built-in works just fine.</p>
<h2>Should We Use Lambdas?</h2>
<p>As demonstrated in this article, lambdas can be documented.
Nevertheless, I'm still not entirely convinced python lambdas should be
used as anything except when an anonymous function is advantageous, i.e
during functional programming.</p>
<h2>What About Other Python Types?</h2>
<p>Enough about lambdas, let's see what else we can do with docstrings.</p>
<h3>Functions and Docstrings</h3>
<p>We know modifying docstrings of functions works, so we'll use it as a
'control'.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># appended to test_docstrings.py
def test_functions():
    # Create a function and test it
    def doubler(x):
        "Doubles strings"
        return " ".join([x, x])
    assert doubler("fun") == "fun fun"
    assert doubler.__doc__ == "Doubles strings"

    # Change the docstring
    doubler.__doc__ = "Really doubles strings"

    # Test that calling __doc__ works
    assert doubler.__doc__ == "Really doubles strings"
</code></pre>
<h3>Strings and Docstrings</h3>
<p>Let's go for something a bit harder. Strings, for example, come with a
docstring, but as Python strings are immutable types, it's read-only
access:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># more appended to test_docstrings.py
def test_strings():
    # Assert that strings come with a built-in doc string
    s = "Hello, world"
    assert s.__doc__ == 'str(object) -> string\n\nReturn a nice string' \
        ' representation of the object.\nIf the argument is a string,' \
        ' the return value is the same object.'

    # Try to set the docstring of a string and you get an AttributeError
    with pytest.raises(AttributeError) as err:
        s.__doc__ = "Stock programming text"

    # The error's value explains the problem...
    assert err.value.message == "'str' object attribute '__doc__' is read-only"
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm... does this mean that we can't assign a docstring to a string?
What if we subclass Python's <code>str</code> type?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Again appended to test_docstrings.py
def test_subclassed_string():

    # Subclass the string type
    class String(str):
        """I am a string class"""

    # Instantiate the string
    s = String("Hello, world")

    # The default docstring is set
    assert s.__doc__ == """I am a string class"""

    # Let's set the docstring
    s.__doc__ = "I am a string object"
    assert s.__doc__ == "I am a string object"
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like it works, but it doesn't do enough. Specifically, this
doesn't satisfy the needs of Python's <code>help()</code> function when called
against the instantiated object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> # REPL again so we can call the help() function
>>> class String(str):
...     """I am a string class"""
...
>>> s = String("Hello, world") # instantiate the String Object
>>> s.__doc__ = "I am a string object"
>>> help(s) # Called against the 's' object, not the 'String' class.
Help on built-in module __builtin__:

NAME
    __builtin__ - Built-in functions, exceptions, and other objects.

FILE
    (built-in)

DESCRIPTION
    Noteworthy: None is the `nil' object; Ellipsis represents `...' in slices.
...
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice in the result of the <code>help()</code> call on the 's' object,
that the phrase, "I am a string object" does not exist.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Python, everything might be an object, but not all objects are
created equal. Lambdas (and functions and objects) do allow for
docstrings, but many, if not all basic types (strings, lists, classes,
etc) for Python do not.</p>
<p>I wonder if I scratch this particular itch long enough I might be able
to create a string-like class that handles the <code>help()</code> issue. If that
happens, maybe I'll add it to <a href="/fixing-pythons-string-class.html">String
Theory</a>. ;-)</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/fiction-vs-non-fiction</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/fiction-vs-non-fiction"/>
        <updated>2014-02-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm a published author.</p>
<p>There, I said it. I co-wrote a
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> and
its
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6">sequel</a>.
My childhood dream of becoming a writer has come true.</p>
<p>Well, not completely.</p>
<p>Truth is, I've always wanted to be a fiction author. Don't get me
wrong, writing a technical book has been a life-worthy experience, with
unbelievable challenges, incredible highs, and soul-crushing lows. I'm
delighted we made it happen, and want to write more technical works.
Still, there are things about writing fiction that have become very
appealing to me.</p>
<h1>Justification</h1>
<p>When you write a technical book, everything has to be justified. I'm
not talking about ensuring proper <em>layout justification</em>, I'm talking
about the concept of <em>content justification</em>.</p>
<p>When writing a technical book, everything is questioned. That's a good
thing, because developers should be a little cynical, questioning
everything. Making certain your writing can stand up to this kind of
scrutiny is a huge amount of work. It's not even whether or not readers
want to believe you, as technical writing leads itself to readers
purposefully or incidentally doing real-world tests of your content.</p>
<p>Of course, making your work a best practices guide means that your
effort really, really, REALLY comes under scrutiny. ;-)</p>
<p>In any case, with fiction, while it's good to have justifiable work,
the critical need for it is normally not there. You just write, and so
long as the reader <strong>feels</strong> that the body of work is believable, you
are okay.</p>
<h1>You Can't Write Tests for Prose</h1>
<p>Two Scoops of Django has tests. Technical articles I write on this blog
now have tests. This is because writing tests up front is a lot more fun
than writing, "Whoops! I'll fix that!"</p>
<p>On the other hand, when writing prose, there are no tests. Every reader
will interpret your work differently. Even if they interpret your work
on similar lines, it's still a personal experience. If I like or
dislike something I read, the way I like or dislike it will differ from
any other reader.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm quite aware of how different people have interpreted the
prose of this blog or Two Scoops of Django. I'm actually quite
fascinated how different people experience my prose, sometimes
misinterpreting what I write, getting beneficial or malignant things out
of it that I never imagined.</p>
<p>You can't write tests for this, it just happens.</p>
<h1>Not Everything Has to Be Described</h1>
<p>When you are writing a technical book, you have to describe all elements
mentioned. Not being a tutorial, Two Scoops of Django allowed us to
truncate a tiny, small amount of things. As any technical author knows,
this represents a huge amount of work.</p>
<p>In fiction, you create characters, scenes, and stories in such a way
that the reader paints it in their mind's eye. If done right, the
reader feels that you've written in an evocative fashion. If done
wrong, the reader is bored and uninspired.</p>
<p>In order to do write evocatively, one technique used is not describing
everything. Authors leave blank spaces. It's these blank spaces that
allow the readers to create their own vista of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm well aware that writing isn't the only medium that uses
blank spaces. Painting, sculpture, film making, music, and every form of
art finds a way to use this technique.</p>
<h1>Eternal Dynamic Characters</h1>
<p>A dynamic character is either a good person who can be bad, or a bad
person who can be good. Using this definition of character in technical
books is challenging and is usually reserved to rants about some
necessary but unpleasant component. Of course, that rant often becomes
dated, as someone who is also annoyed by the same component creates
something that replaces it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in fiction dynamic characters survive as long as they
are in print. We can read again and again stories about heroes and
anti-heroes, and recommend them to our associates.</p>
<p>This is a permanence I long to have in my writing.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For these reasons and many more, fiction wins.</p>
<p>I'm writing! It's challenging but engaging. I won't speak much about
what I'm writing, except to say it falls in the 'fantasy and science
fiction' genre.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/announcing-two-scoops-of-django-1.6"/>
        <updated>2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6"><img src="/images/two-scoops-django-co-authors-M.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>We (Audrey Roy and I) just released the <strong>revised</strong>, <strong>expanded</strong>, and
<strong>slightly renamed</strong> second edition of our book on Django. It's called
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.6</a>, and
you can buy it right now in print format on our <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6">online
store</a> or
<a href="https://amzn.to/1n98duC">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.6 is chock-full of
even more material that will help you with your Django projects. We'll
introduce you to various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and
techniques that we've picked up over the years. We have put thousands
of hours into writing and revising its hundreds of pages of concise,
example-packed text.</p>
<h2>Why Should You Purchase the Second Edition?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I read the first edition cover to cover. The second one raises the
bar again. It's pedagogical, entertaining, and thoughtful."</p>
<p>-- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6
Reviewer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should you buy this updated version of our previous book? Well,
it's more than a slight rename, it's been
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list">revised</a>
and
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list">expanded</a>!</p>
<h2>It's Revised</h2>
<p>Significant portions of the previous material have been revised,
incorporating huge amounts of feedback submitted by our readers over the
past year. We listened to suggestions, clarified existing content, and
incorporated useful tips into the book, carefully curating what went in
and what didn't. Our goal was to make the existing content even more
succinct and worth reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I disagree with the idea that running tests on SQLite is OK, for the
same reasons developing on SQLite causes problems."</p>
<p>-- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6
Reviewer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with writing the previous edition, we asked numerous subject matter
experts on security, databases, deployment and more for their feedback
and advice. We're not afraid to ask questions or to ask the best and
brightest to find fault with our work. It's hard to be told you're
wrong by those who you respect, and even harder to change patterns you
promoted. However, we believe it's our duty to the readers to make our
book the best is can be.</p>
<h2>It's Expanded</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Can Two Scoops of Django expand the deployment chapter?"</p>
<p>-- Most frequently-asked request</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had countless requests for more content from readers around the
world. People asked us to cover more and more stuff and we've done our
best to comply. We have new material on function-based views, Django
1.6-era transactions, deployment, internationalization, Python 3,
identical environments, and more.</p>
<p>In fact...</p>
<h3>We expanded the book so much that <strong>3 > 4</strong>:</h3>
<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6"><img src="/images/3vs4-M.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>This isn't to say that we padded the book. Not at all. The new material
is packed with our loud volume of code examples and concise
explanations. We would like to think it's awesome, but that's because
we had the whole world helping us put it together.</p>
<h2>We Did It Together</h2>
<p>I believe this new edition is amazing. As I said before, we didn't do
it alone, we had you in our corner. By you, I mean the technical
reviewers and readers giving us support and feedback. We did it for you,
the Python and Django developers around the world.</p>
<p>Which means I'm delighted that our latest effort is finally in print.
In my perfect world it gets a thousand five star reviews. ;-)</p>

        <updated>2014-01-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <a href="/awesome-slugify-human-readable-url-slugs-from-any-string.html">blog
post</a>
I covered using
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awesome-slugify">awesome-slugify</a> to
capture slugs in both ASCII and unicode. Today I'm covering the
definition custom language <code>slugify</code> translation functions.</p>
<h2>Defining Custom Language <code>slugify</code> Translation Functions</h2>
<p>For those times we need ASCII representation of unicode characters, we
can't always use the default unicode-to-ASCII mappings. A powerful
feature of <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is we can quickly and easily create our
own translation functions. Just follow these two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a translation dictionary. Keys are the names of things you
want translated, and the associated values are what the keys are
translated into.</li>
<li>Generate a translation function using <code>slugify.main.get_slugify()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Explaining this in depth will take paragraphs of text, so I'll just
demonstrate it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">emoji</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_slugify_emoji.py

from slugify import get_slugify
import pytest

# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary
ALT_EMOJI = {
    u'ʘ‿ʘ': u'smiling',
    u'ಠ_ಠ': u'disapproval',
    u'♥‿♥': u'enamored',
    u'♥': u'love',
}

# Step 2: Generate a translation function
slugify_emoji = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_EMOJI)

def test_basic_emoji():
    assert slugify_emoji(u"ʘ‿ʘ") == u"smiling"
    assert slugify_emoji(u"ಠ_ಠ") == u"disapproval"

def test_sentence():
    txt = u"I ♥ Audrey Roy Greenfeld"
    assert slugify_emoji(txt) == u"I-love-Audrey-Roy-Greenfeld"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/i-%E2%99%A5-your-unicode-smile.png" alt="I ♥ your unicode smile"></p>
<h3>More Practical Applications</h3>
<p>While writing an <strong>emoji</strong>-based translation function is fun, most of
the time we need more practical translation functions. Built into
<strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is a cyrillic translation function that works like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_slugify_cyrillic.py
from slugify import get_slugify
import pytest

# The following code is nearly identical to the source code of
#   awesome-slugify. All credit goes to Dmitry Voronin.

# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary
ALT_CYRILLIC = {
    u'ё': u'e',    # instead of 'io' / 'yo'
    u'ж': u'j',    # instead of 'zh'
    u'у': u'y',    # instead of 'u'
    u'х': u'h',    # instead of 'kh'
    u'щ': u'sch',  # instead of 'shch'
    u'ю': u'u',    # instead of 'iu' / 'yu'
    u'я': u'ya',   # instead of 'ia'
}

# Step 2: Generate a translation function
slugify_ru = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_CYRILLIC)

def test_some_cyrillic():
    txt = u"ж and я are really fun letters."
    assert slugify_ru(txt) == u"j-and-ya-are-really-fun-letters"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://bikeshedder.com/">Michael P. Jung</a> created a German translation
function, which I've included below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_slugify_german.py
from slugify import get_slugify
import pytest

# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary
ALT_GERMAN = {
    u'ä': u'ae',
    u'Ä': u'Ae',
    u'ö': u'oe',
    u'Ö': u'Oe',
    u'ü': u'ue',
    u'Ü': u'Ue'
}

# Step 2: Generate a translation function
slugify_de = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_GERMAN)

def test_german_dumpling():
    # According to Michael P. Jung, this looks like ice cream.
    assert slugify_de(u'Thüringer Klöße') == u"Thueringer-Kloesse"

def test_german_road():
    txt = u"I've never been in a car on a German straße"
    assert slugify_de(txt) == u"Ive-never-been-in-a-car-on-a-German-strasse"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I really like the flexibility and power of <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>. During
slugification it provides functions to preserve unicode characters,
convert unicode characters to ASCII, and even define new translation
functions. As <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is a relatively new project, there are
<a href="https://github.com/dimka665/awesome-slugify/issues">a few issues</a>, but
most of those are for my quirky edge cases (such as when trying to use
parenthesis in translation dictionaries for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons">emoticons</a>) or perhaps stem
from my poor understanding of how unicode-to-ASCII functions.</p>
<p>In any case, this is a very useful package.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013/01/23</strong> Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dimka665">Dmitry
Voronin</a>, I removed references to a couple
issues with <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>. It no longer forces capitalization in
custom translation functions and the <code>get_slugify()</code> can be imported
directly from the base <code>slugify</code> package.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/awesome-slugify-human-readable-url-slugs-from-any-string"/>
        <updated>2014-01-21T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>note: The introduction mentions Django and Plone. However, this is not
an article about Django or Plone.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Years ago, when I was working with <a href="https://plone.org">Plone</a> at
<a href="https://nasa.gov">NASA</a>, one thing I dreaded was when content editors
would copy-and-paste from Microsoft Word into the title bar. All kinds
of funny characters would appear in the title bar and URL. I would have
to go into the database (ZODB) and fix things. Things didn't get better
until <a href="https://github.com/reedobrien">Reed O'Brien</a> turned on a title
validator (probably in <code>Plone.i18n</code>).</p>
<p>When we started using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, one thing
that made it nice was the presence of it's
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/utils/#module-django.utils.text">slugify()</a>
function and template filter. Inspired by the newspaper industry, this
function it easier on both content editors and software engineers. In
any case, using <code>slugify()</code> we completed a number of projects, with
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/">NASA Science</a> being the only public one I
worked on.</p>
<p>As much as the <code>slugify()</code> function was useful, there were problems. As
I discovered time and time again over the years, it didn't handle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicode</a>. Or rather, it handled
them by simply vanishing non-ASCII unicode characters. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from django.utils.text import slugify
>>> slugify(u"straße") # German for road
u"strae"
</code></pre>
<p>If you read German, you'll know that the default Django <code>slugify()</code>
function is converting the word 'road' to nonsense. For sites dealing
with internationalization, this won't do. So over three years ago while
at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>
engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/davedash">Dave Dash</a> created
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-slugify">unicode-slugify</a>. From
then on we could do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from slugify import slugify
>>> slugify(u"straße") # Again with the German word for road
u"straße"
</code></pre>
<h3>What If I'm Not Using Django?</h3>
<p>While a very nice tool, this package is dependent on Django's internal
machinery to operate, which is a problem for non-Django users. While we
could use Python's <a href="https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/5/">unicodedata library to resolve unicode to
slugs</a>, wouldn't it be nice if
there was a nicely packaged/tested solution?</p>
<p>Fortunately, such a nicely packaged/tested solution exists, and it's
awesome!</p>
<p><img src="/images/awesome_slugify_django.jpg" alt="An Awesome Django slug"></p>
<h2>Introducing awesome-slugify</h2>
<p>Created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/dimka665">Dmitry Voronin</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awesome-slugify">awesome-slugify</a> is easy
to use and <strong>100% independent from Django</strong>. You call it thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> import slugify
>>> slugify.slugify(u"straße") # Yet again the German for road
u'strasse'
</code></pre>
<p>Works! Hooray!</p>
<p>However, please note that unlike the Django-only <strong>unicode-slugify</strong>
package which preserves the non-ASCII characters, <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>
transformed the German 'ß' into an ASCII substitution of 'ss'. This
is similar to how the popular
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-slugify">python-slugify</a> package
works. While this behavior of translating unicode to ASCII might work
for English-only sites, it's not so useful for the rest of the world.
Fortunately, <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> also provides the incredibly useful
<code>slugify_unicode()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> import slugify
>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u"straße") # What is it with German Roads?
u'stra\xdfe'
>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u"straße") == u"straße"
True
</code></pre>
<h3>Using awesome-slugify</h3>
<p>Rather than describe <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> in paragraph format, here is
working test code (<a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">using pytest which I described
before</a>) that
explains what we can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_awesome_slugify.py
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import pytest
from slugify import slugify, slugify_unicode

def test_simple():
    txt = "This is basic functionality!!!    "
    assert slugify(txt) == "This-is-basic-functionality"

def test_remove_special_characters():
    txt = "special characters (#?@$%^&#x26;*) are also ASCII"
    assert slugify(txt) == "special-characters-are-also-ASCII"

def test_basic_accents_and_backslash_escapes():
    txt = 'Where I've gone before'
    assert slugify(txt) == "Where-Ive-gone-before"

@pytest.fixture
def accents():
    return u'Àddîñg áçćèńtš tô Éñgłïśh íš śīłłÿ!'

def test_accents(accents):
    assert slugify(accents) == "Adding-accents-to-English-is-silly"

def test_keep_accents(accents):
    assert slugify_unicode(accents) == \
                        'Àddîñg-áçćèńtš-tô-Éñgłïśh-íš-śīłłÿ'

def test_keep_accents_lower(accents):
    # Because awesome-slugify doesn't lower() while slugify, we
    #   have to do it ourselves. I'm torn if I like this or hate it
    assert slugify_unicode(accents).lower() == \
                        'àddîñg-áçćèńtš-tô-éñgłïśh-íš-śīłłÿ'

def test_musical_notes():
    txt = "Is ♬ ♫ ♪ ♩ a melody or just noise?"
    assert slugify(txt) == "Is-a-melody-or-just-noise"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt) == "Is-a-melody-or-just-noise"

def test_chinese():
    txt = "美国" # Chinese for 'America'
    assert slugify(txt) == "Mei-Guo"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt) ==  "美国"

def test_separator():
    txt = "Separator is a word I frequently mispell."
    result = slugify(txt, separator="_", capitalize=False)
    assert result == "Separator_is_a_word_I_frequently_mispell"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>Easy to use as any good <code>slugify()</code> function!</p>
<h3>Restricting the length of a returned slug</h3>
<p>When using <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>'s <code>slugify()</code> and <code>slugify_unicode()</code>
functions, the <code>max_length</code> argument acts in an interesting fashion. On
very short strings it removes longer words to make things fit. As the
author of <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is Russian, and the Russian language, as
far as I know, doesn't have prepositions (words like 'the' and 'a')
this makes sense.</p>
<p>Let's take a look, shall we?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_awesome_slugify_max_length.py
import pytest
from slugify import slugify, slugify_unicode

def test_max_length_tiny():
    # Removes the longer words to fit smaller words in.
    txt = "$ is a special character, as is #."
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=10) == "is-a-as-is"

def test_max_length_medium():
    # Keeps in prepositions, but removes meaningful words.
    txt = "$ is a special character, as is #."
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=15) == "is-a-special-as"

def test_max_length_realistic():
    # Long enough that long words are not removed from the string in favor
    #   of shorter words.
    txt = """This sentence illuminates the method that this package
                handles truncation of longer strings.
    """
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=50) == \
        "This-sentence-illuminates-the-method-that-this-of"

# The next few tests cover how the max_length argument handles truncation
#   inside of a word. When working with longer word languages, like German,
#   understanding how your chosen slugify() function works is important.

def test_truncating_word():
    # This demonstrates taking a long German word and truncating it.
    txt = u"Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz"
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=40) == \
                "Rindfleischetikettierungsuberwachungsauf"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt, max_length=40) == \
                u"Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsauf"

def test_truncating_varying_letter_size():
    # Truncating unicode slugs is challenging. For example, the German
    #   letter 'ß' is 'ss' in English. Should a slugify's max_length
    #   argument use the German or the English length? In the case of
    #   awesome-slugify, it uses the length of English letter for both the
    #   slugify() and slugify_unicode() functions.
    txt = u"straße" # I really can't stop using German roads.
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=5) == "stras"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt, max_length=5) == u"straß"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>As demonstrated, <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> covers many common use cases.
Nevertheless, in <a href="/awesome-slugify-human-readable-url-slugs-from-any-string-2.html">my next blog
post</a>
I cover how to write custom language <code>slugify()</code> translation functions
using <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013/01/23</strong> Thanks to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flying-sheep">flying-sheep</a>, I Changed
'equivalent' to 'substitution' in describing the unicode-to-ASCII
translation. This is because 'ss' is not a precise translation of
'ß'.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-3"/>
        <updated>2014-01-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-2.html">blog
post</a> I
covered writing exception-based assertions and fixtures. Today I'm
going to close things out by demonstrating how to change the behavior of
<a href="https://pytest.org/">pytest</a> and how to integrate it with <strong>Django</strong> and
<code>setup.py</code>.</p>
<h1>Changing the Behavior of <strong>pytest</strong></h1>
<p>When <strong>pytest</strong> is called, either via the command-line or by
<code>pytest.main()</code>, it <a href="https://pytest.org/latest/customize.html#how-test-configuration-is-read-from-configuration-ini-files">looks for a configuration
file</a>
called either <code>pytest.ini</code>, <code>tox.ini</code>, and <code>setup.cfg</code>. If it finds a
configuration file, it follows standard practices for those things. In
the following example, I demonstrating searching for tests inside of all
Python files while ignoring the <code>**_build**</code> directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini"># pytest.ini (or tox.ini or setup.cfg)
[pytest] # You must put pytest-related controls in a 'pytest' block
python_files=*.py  # Run tests against all python modules
norecursedirs = _build # Don't look inside of _build directories
</code></pre>
<h2>Changing <strong>pytest</strong> Behavior Dynamically</h2>
<p>This is pretty nice, but if I need to ignore certain Python modules like
<code>setup.py</code>? I can do this by creating a <code>conftest.py</code> module and
defining a <code>collect_ignore</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># conftest.py
collect_ignore = ["setup.py", "conftest.py"]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>conftest.py</code> module can actually be defined per directory. So if
test behavior needs to change in different packages, just create
additional <code>conftest.py</code> modules. It's simple to do, but really
powerful.</p>
<p>The <code>conftest</code> module is capable of a lot of other things. Right now
there doesn't seem to be a page that documents it in full, so I'm
considering submitting a documentation pull request. In the meantime, I
live off the <code>conftest.py</code> <a href="https://pytest.org/latest/search.html?q=conftest&#x26;check_keywords=yes&#x26;area=default">search
results</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>pytest</strong> is Plug-In Driven</h2>
<p>One feature I really like about <strong>pytest</strong> is that much of it's default
capabilities are driven by about 20 plug-ins. It's a sign of maturity
that not only does it have plug-ins, but that most of the time this
feature is transparent. You can add new plug-ins to your project in a
<a href="https://pytest.org/latest/plugins.html#plugin-discovery-order-at-tool-startup">number of
ways</a>,
including <code>pip</code> installation from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/">PyPI</a>.
For locally defined plug-ins I prefer to rely on explicit <code>conftest.py</code>
declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># conftest.py
collect_ignore = ["setup.py", "conftest.py"]
pytest_plugins = ["dream_plugin", "dream.utils.testplugin"]
</code></pre>
<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&#x26;term=pytest-&#x26;submit=search">third-party pytest
plug-ins</a>,
which brings me to the next major section: Integration with other tools
and frameworks.</p>
<h1>Django Integration is Just a Plug-In Away</h1>
<p>If you want to use <strong>pytest</strong> instead of <strong>Django</strong>'s test runner and
also get the power of function-based tests, fixture functions, improved
test discover, and all the stuff I haven't covered, then check out
and/or <code>pip</code> install
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-django">pytest-django</a>. My
<em>admittedly brief</em> usage on some of my existing projects has
demonstrating that my existing <strong>unittest</strong>-style tests work.</p>
<p>That previous tests still function means that as with a pure Python
project, I can rely on existing <strong>unittests</strong> and write all my new tests
as functions. I guess I could say that my existing Django projects just
got much easier to maintain.</p>
<p>A good example of using <strong>pytest</strong> with <strong>Django</strong> can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/blob/master/tox.ini">django-braces' tox.ini
file</a>.</p>
<h2>Twisted (and more) Integration is Just a Plug-In Away</h2>
<p>The same goes for <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> thanks to
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-twisted">pytest-twisted</a>. There is
also a <a href="https://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a> plug-in that was just
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest_pyramid">released</a>. I'm not sure
if <a href="https://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> needs it, but I guess there will be
<strong>Flask</strong> plug-in soon.</p>
<h1>Integration With <code>setup.py</code></h1>
<p>Fortunately, the documentation for <strong>pytest</strong> covers both adding a new
<a href="https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integrating-with-distutils-python-setup-py-test">setup.py command-classes for
pytest</a>
and <a href="https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integration-with-setuptools-test-commands">actual
integration</a>.
That's handy, but what I've found even more useful is the <a href="https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman/blob/develop/setup.py">setup.py
that Jeff Knupp wrote for his Sandman
project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you aren't experienced with writing Python packages and
readying them for <strong>PyPI</strong>, I recommend you read <a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/">Jeff Knupp's blog
post on open sourcing
projects</a>.
Amongst other things, it has an in-depth discussion about integration of
<strong>pytest</strong> with <code>setup.py</code>. Anything I would write on the subject of
<code>setup.py</code> integration would be just a cheap knock-off of Jeff's
excellent work.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Tests are an important part of any project. While they increase the
stability of a project, that unfortunately can come at the cost of the
boredom of writing tests. Fortunately, <strong>pytest</strong> goes a long way to
alleviating that boredom while also empowering Python code authors with
lots of additional useful tools. I'm delighted to have finally
discovered <strong>pytest</strong>. In the short time I've used <strong>pytest</strong>, it's
saved me days, if not weeks, of tedious work.</p>

        <updated>2014-01-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">blog
post</a> I covered
test discovery and writing basic tests using
<a href="https://pytest.org/">pytest</a>. Today I'm going to cover a few more
features that I really enjoy: <code>raises</code> and <code>fixtures</code>.</p>
<h1>The Intuitively Named <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong></h1>
<p>When using <strong>pytest</strong>, you can assert whether or not an exception
occurred via the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_exceptions.py
from pytest import raises

def test_an_exception():
    with raises(IndexError):
        # Indexing the 30th item in a 3 item list
        [5, 10, 15][30]

class CustomException(Exception):
    pass

def test_my_exception():
    with raises(CustomException):
        raise CustomException
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to, but just a bit easier to remember than the
implementation in
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>.</p>
<p>What I like about it is that even if I step away from code and tests for
enough time to go on vacation and <a href="/i-married-audrey-roy.html">get
married</a>, when I come
back I always remember the precise name of the <strong>context manager</strong> used
to raise exceptions.</p>
<h1>Fixtures as Function Arguments</h1>
<p>When writing tests, it's not uncommon to need common objects used
between tests. However, if you have a complicated process to generate
these common objects, then you have to write tests for your tests. When
using Python's venerable <strong>unittest</strong> framework, this always causes a
spaghetti-code headache. However, via the virtue of simplicity,
<strong>pytest</strong> helps keep our test code cleaner and more maintainable.</p>
<p>Rather than try and explain that further, I'll write some code to get
my point across:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_fixtures.py
from pytest import fixture

@fixture  # Registering this function as a fixture.
def complex_data():
    # Creating test data entirely in this function to isolate it
    #   from the rest of this module.
    class DataTypes(object):
        string = str
        list = list
    return DataTypes()

def test_types(complex_data): # fixture is passed as an argument
    assert isinstance("Elephant", complex_data.string)
    assert isinstance([5, 10, 15], complex_data.list)
</code></pre>
<p>Nice and simple, which is how I think test harnesses should operate.</p>
<h2>Writing Tests for Fixtures</h2>
<p>Let's pretend that the <code>complex_data()</code> is a terribly sophisticated
function in it's own right. It's so sophisticated that I can't
determine what it's actually doing, and I start to get worried.
Fortunately, because the <code>complex_data()</code> argument itself is written as
a function, I can easily write a test for it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_fixtures.py
# note: this version of test_fixtures.py is built off the previous example

def test_complex_data(complex_data):
    assert isinstance(complex_data, object)
    assert complex_data.string == str
    assert complex_data.list == list
</code></pre>
<p>Now that I can easily write tests for my fixtures, that means I can
refactor them! I can replace difficult-to-use libraries with easier
ones, break up giant functions into little ones, and generally simplify
the unnecessarily complex.</p>
<p>If you've ever been in that weird place where a <strong>unittest</strong> <code>setUp()</code>
method is indecipherable, you know just how useful this can be.</p>
<h2>Scoping Fixtures</h2>
<p>What if I want a fixture that shares it's scope across several test
functions?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_fixtures_with_scope.py
from pytest import fixture

@fixture(scope="module")  # Registering fixture with module-level scope
def scope_data():
    return {"count": 0}

def test_first(scope_data):
    assert scope_data["count"] == 0
    scope_data["count"] += 1

def test_second(scope_data):
    assert scope_data["count"] == 1
</code></pre>
<h2>Executing Teardown Code</h2>
<p>I can tear down data structures in them. This is useful for any sort of
data binding, including file management.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test_fixtures_with_teardown.py
from pytest import fixture

@fixture
def file_data(request): # The fixture MUST have a 'request' argument
    text = open("data.txt", "w")

    @request.addfinalizer
    def teardown():
        text.close()
    return text

def test_data_type(file_data):
    assert isinstance(file_data, file)
</code></pre>
<p>What's really nice about this teardown feature is that when combined
with the fixture decorator's <code>scope</code> argument, I can exactly control
when fixtures are taken down. This is an amazing piece of control. While
I can and have duplicated this behavior using <strong>unittest</strong>, with
<strong>pytest</strong> I can do it with more obvious code.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first encountered Holger Krekel's <a href="https://pytest.org/">pytest</a>
this summer on <a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/">Jeff Knupp's
blog</a>
I felt like I had been living under a rock for years. I've been using
Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
framework since 2006 and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose">nose</a> to
find tests since 2008, but here was another test framework that actually
predates <strong>nose</strong>! <strong>pytest</strong> is a very mature testing tool for testing
Python. My favorite features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can run <strong>unittest</strong>, <strong>doctest</strong>, and <strong>nose</strong>, style tests
suites, making it ideal for new and legacy projects.</li>
<li>It includes an intuitively named <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong> for
testing exceptions.</li>
<li>You can define fixture arguments to generate baseline data. This is
very, very different from Django-style fixtures.</li>
<li>Via <code>pytest.ini</code> you can change the behavior of pytest.</li>
<li>Integrates nicely with <code>setup.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, lets dive into usage.</p>
<h1>Test Discovery</h1>
<p>The first thing that <strong>pytest</strong> provides is test discovery. Like
<strong>nose</strong>, starting from the directory where it is run, it will find any
Python module prefixed with <code>test_</code> and will attempt to run any defined
<strong>unittest</strong> or function prefixed with <code>test_</code>. <strong>pytest</strong> explores
properly defined Python packages, searching recursively through
directories that include <code>__init__.py</code> modules. Since an image is
probably easier to read, here's a sample directory structure annotated
with which files are checked for tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">address/
    __init__.py
    envelope.py 
    geo.py 
    test_envelope.py # checked for tests
    test_geo.py # checked for tests
records/
    # pytest WON'T look here because it lacks __init__.py
    records.csv
    records.py
    test_records.py # skipped because records/ lacks __init__.py
__init__.py
main.py
test_main.py  # checked for tests
</code></pre>
<p>Now that I've explained which files are checked for tests, here is how
<strong>pytest</strong> determines what in each Python module is run as a test.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>pytest</strong> <em>just runs</em> <strong>doctests</strong> and <strong>unittests</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>pytest</strong> runs any function prefixed with <code>test_</code> as a test.</li>
<li><strong>pytest</strong> does <a href="https://pytest.org/latest/nose.html#unsupported-idioms-known-issues">its
best</a>
to run tests written for <strong>nose</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, <strong>pytest</strong> behaves similarly to <strong>nose</strong> in test discovery. Next is
another feature that it shares with <strong>nose</strong> that I really enjoy.</p>
<h1>Writing Tests as Functions</h1>
<p>Python's <strong>unittest</strong> framework works, but it's always felt like too
much boilerplate. I admit I like to write tests, but working with the
<strong>unittest</strong> framework always dimmed that fun. I suppose this is why the
assert keyword is useful, because it changes this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import unittest

class TestMyStuff(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_the_obvious(self):
        self.assertEqual(True, True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> assert True == True
</code></pre>
<p>The former is nine lines of code (seven if you are using <strong>pytest</strong> to
find this test) to do what the assert statement does in one. However,
the nine lines of <strong>unittest</strong> code has a couple major advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not automatically run when stumbled on by the Python interpreter.</li>
<li>Produces a more illuminating response than an uninformative
AssertionError.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, tools like <strong>pytest</strong> (and <strong>nose</strong>) provide the ability to
write tests as functions. This means we can combine the advantages of
both <code>unittest</code> and <code>assert</code> thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_the_obvious():
    assert True == True
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are down to just two lines of code! That could be increased to
five if we called <strong>pytest</strong> the same as we did in the <strong>unittest</strong>
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pytest

def test_the_obvious():
    assert True == True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>The next part is wonderful. If an <code>assert</code> statement fails, then
<strong>pytest</strong> provides a very informative response. Let's check it out by
running the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pytest

def test_gonna_fail():
    assert True == False  # Going to fail here on line 4

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pytest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>When I run this code, I get the following response:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">==================== FAILURES =====================
----------------- test_gonna_fail -----------------

    def test_gonna_fail():
>       assert True == False
E       assert True == False

samples.py:4: AssertionError
======== 1 failed, 0 passed in 0.1 seconds ========
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, pytest identified where the <code>assert</code> statement failed on
line 4 and displays exactly caused the failure (<code>True</code> did not equal
<code>False</code>). Very nice indeed.</p>
<h1>What's Next?</h1>
<p>In my next <a href="/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-2.html">blog
post</a> I
describe the following features of writing tests with <strong>pytest</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong></li>
<li>Fixtures</li>
<li>Fixture Teardown</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a small, private family ceremony on December 27th, 2013 I exchanged
wedding vows with <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vows.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>It was an incredible day. I'll savor the moment we promised ourselves
to each other in matrimony forever. She is the other half of my soul,
and since we've become husband and wife, everything has changed. The
world is simply a better place to be.</p>
<p>Audrey wore my mother's 1961 wedding dress and her wedding ring was my
grandmother's. These symbolized the close bond Audrey has with my
family. I was wearing a tuxedo and for the occasion taught myself how to
tie a bow tie. The flowers were a combined effort of Audrey, her aunt,
and her cousin. Audrey made the wedding cake figurines herself.</p>
<h1>Honeymoon</h1>
<p>We experienced so much of the world in 2013 that we don't feel inclined
to race off to an exotic honeymoon quite yet. We are tentatively
thinking of a road trip in the USA, but are open to suggestions.</p>
<h1>Future Celebrations</h1>
<p>We're thinking of planning a fun, casual outdoor reception in late
March in Southern California. We're not absolutely certain yet, because
at big events you barely have time to say hello to everyone. Still, it
could be fun...</p>
<h1>More Photos</h1>
<p>This image is a link to a short collection of photos from the incredible
photographer, Lindy DiMaio. More to come:</p>

        <updated>2013-08-17T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Jeff Knupp wrote an amazing how-to article called "<a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/">Open
Sourcing a Python Project the Right
Way</a>".
While I was reading it, I was rather pleased by just how close it is to
my own practices. Considering Jeff's amazing
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5KG0F8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00B5KG0F8&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mlinar-20">Writing</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5VXMRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00B5VXMRG&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mlinar-20">Idiomatic</a>
<a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/">Python</a>, it
meant I was on the right track.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is implementation. Creating reusable Python
packages has always been annoying. There are no defined/maintained best
practices (especially for <code>setup.py</code>), so you end up cutting and pasting
hacky, poorly understood, often legacy code from one project to the
other. Some of it does nothing and some of it fails catastrophically on
Python 3. There's a term for this sort of behavior, and it's called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">Cargo Cult
programming</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while I was
<a href="/made-up-statistics.html#debate-statistics">ranting</a>
and
<a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/">Jeff</a>
(and <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/">Hynek
Schlawack</a>)
was writing, someone was making
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>.</p>
<h2>cookiecutter does one thing and it does it well</h2>
<p>What <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> does is
make creating and maintaining project templates easy and intuitive. This
allow developers of all languages (not just Python) the ability to break
free from cargo-cult configuration and follow patterns dictated by the
experts who present their own cookiecutter templates. So if you don't
like how the author of cookiecutter's creates her projects, you can use
someone else's or roll your own.</p>
<p>Okay, enough talk, let's use cookiecutter to build a Python project.
Assuming you have <a href="https://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a> installed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip install cookiecutter
</code></pre>
<p><strong>note</strong>: In the works is a <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew</a>
package, and possibly packages for the various Linux distributions as
well.</p>
<p>Done? Okay, now use cookiecutter to create your Python project. For this
example, I'm going to create a sample project called "<em>cheese</em>".:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
Cloning into 'cookiecutter-pypackage'...

full_name (default is "Audrey Roy")? Daniel Greenfeld
project_name (default is "your project")? cheese
... snip for brevity
</code></pre>
<p>See how it asks my full name? Well, at this point,
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> begins to ask a
number of questions. These questions are actually specified in the
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json">cookiecutter.json</a>
file for
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've answered everything that
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>
wants, it generates your project. Let's go and check:</p>

<p>While there are <em>some</em> differences from Jeff Knupp's example in his
<a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/">article</a>
(ReStructuredText vs Markdown, location of tests, etc), I would argue
that the general vision is the same. Better yet, if Jeff (or someone)
wants to implement Jeff's pattern, they can.</p>
<p>In fact...</p>
<h2>Creating cookiecutter templates is easy and intuitive</h2>
<p>All you have to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fork</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>
<strong>and rename it</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Make the changes you desire.</strong> You can change anything you want,
the setup.py, the test handling, or perhaps add or remove from the
questions specified in
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json">cookiecutter.json</a>.
Right now <strong>repo_name</strong> is a mandatory
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json">cookiecutter.json</a>
field, but there is an issue submitted to have that changed.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that renders everything in</strong>
<a href="https://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>. Questions asked by
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json">cookiecutter.json</a>
are rendered to the project's files (be those files in Python,
Javascript, HTML, etc). So if you add a field to
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json">cookiecutter.json</a>,
all you have to do to see it in a templates is write:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-django"># Place in Python, HTML. Javascript, CSS, Markdown, or any other plaintext format.
{{cookiecutter.my_new_field}}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Submit a pull request to</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> asking for
their project to be listed on the README.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not hard. In fact, there is already a growing ecosystem of
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter#available-templates">cookiecutter
templates</a>,
including Python, <a href="https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask">Flask</a>,
<a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/cookiecutter/">Django</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-jquery">JQuery</a> templates.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is already a
<a href="https://github.com/Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage">fork</a> of
cookiecutter-pypackage that even more closely matches Jeff Knupp's
design.</p>
<h2>Additional cookiecutter features</h2>
<p>Here are more things to like about cookiecutter:</p>
<h3>cookiecutter is focused</h3>
<p>It doesn't handle deployment, serving of HTTP, testing, or anything
else. All it does is project templates. It follows those classic words,
"<em>It's programmed to do one thing and do it well</em>".</p>
<h3>Supports all modern versions of Python</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.6</li>
<li>Python 2.7</li>
<li>Python 3.3</li>
<li>Even PyPy!</li>
</ul>
<h3>cookiecutter is modular</h3>
<p>It's not built off a single giant function, or a complex architecture.
Instead, it's comprised of a number of relatively simple functions.
Why? Well this way you can import easily elements of cookiecutter into
other projects, and it plays into the next feature:</p>
<h3>cookiecutter is tested</h3>
<p>The project has as of August 20th 2013, <a href="https://coveralls.io/r/audreyr/cookiecutter?branch=master">98% test
coverage</a>,
with an intention to increase it to 100%. This makes handling the
following things much easier/safer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementing new features without breaking existing ones.</li>
<li>Handling new versions of Python as they emerge.</li>
</ol>
<h3>cookiecutter isn't just for Python packages</h3>
<p>That's correct. While at the moment there is only
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-jquery">cookiecutter-jquery</a>,
there is nothing to stop developers from using
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> to create
templates for anything. The way it renders output is designed to
accommodate customizations for any tool.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point...</p>
<h3>cookiecutter isn't just for Python developers</h3>
<p>Even if you don't know Python you can use
<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>. The templating
is done via <a href="https://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>, which isn't far off from
other template languages like Mustache, Handlebars, or Liquid. if you
are worried about collisions between templating systems, just use
Jinja2's <code>{% raw %}</code> template tag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{# Jinja2's raw template to escape the Liquid template inside #}
{% raw %} {# Liquid template from here on #}
&#x3C;ul id="products">
{% for product in products %}
&#x3C;li>
  &#x3C;h2>{{ product.title }}&#x3C;/h2>
  Only {{ product.price | format_as_money }}

  &#x3C;p>{{ product.description | prettyprint | truncate: 200  }}&#x3C;/p>

&#x3C;/li>
{% endfor %}
&#x3C;/ul>
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update 09/20/2013</strong>: Test coverage increased to 98% from 91%.</li>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/made-up-statistics"/>
        <updated>2013-07-26T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Years ago my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/maraujop">Miguel Araujo</a>
and I presented on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/pydanny/p/advanced-django-forms-usage">Advanced Django Form
Usage</a>.
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/advanced-django-forms-usage/52">Slide
18</a> of
that talk mentioned some made up statistics. Here they are for
reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>91% of Django projects use ModelForms.</li>
<li>80% ModelForms require trivial logic.</li>
<li>20% ModelForms require complex logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Chapter 10 of <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/">Two Scoops of Django</a> I
expanded on those made up statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>95% of Django projects should use ModelForms.</li>
<li>91% of all Django projects use ModelForms.</li>
<li>80% of ModelForms require trivial logic.</li>
<li>20% of ModelForms require complicated logic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Disclaimer</strong>: These numbers were cooked out of thin air by
yours truly. I determined them with zero research, they carry absolutely
no scientific weight, and shouldn't be used in any serious argument.
They are wholly my opinion, which is good or bad depending on your point
of view and your own opinion of my opinions.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here's a bar graph created from the fictional
data I presented with Miguel back in 2011:</p>
<p><img src="/images/made-up-statistics.png" alt="image">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>
<p>You'll notice that my bar titles could be stronger. I actually did that
on purpose in case anyone tries to use that chart in real life. In any
case, if you thought that was interesting, then read on. I have many
more made-up statistics. For example, here are more numbers I've cooked
up:</p>
<h1>Pydanny Made Up DevOps Statistics</h1>
<p>Thanks to the cloud and a blizzard of hip, new tools, DevOps is the new
hotness. I know because every other Python meetup features someone
speaking on it - just like every other Ruby, Perl, and PHP meetup.
Anyway... numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>24.3% of <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a> developers doing DevOps think
they could have launched a PaaS (aka Heroku clone) before it got
crowded.</li>
<li>46.3% of Python developers doing DevOps spend all their time writing
Chef/Puppet scripts and yet still claim to be Python developers.</li>
<li>14% of Python developers are worried about so much of the backend
being done in Ruby, but don't quite trust Salt or Ansible enough to
use them.</li>
<li>54% of Python developers are just happy that there are many options
now and don't care about the internal machinery that much.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, because I'm worried about the data being taken seriously,
I've titled the bar chart in such a way that no one will reference it
in anything important:</p>
<p><img src="/images/devops.png" alt="image"></p>
<h1>Pydanny Made Up Python Enviroment Statistics</h1>
<p>Following the obvious logic flow (to me anyway) of DevOps to something
else, let's go into Python environments, also known as the
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">VirtualEnv</a> vs
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">Buildout</a> debate, which adds
up to an even 100% (making it good pie chart material):</p>
<ul>
<li>77% of Python Developers prefer VirtualEnv.</li>
<li>13% of Python Developers prefer Buildout. Many of them don't say
this out loud.</li>
<li>7% of Python developers rolled their own solution and <strong>wish they
could switch over.</strong></li>
<li>3% of Python developers rolled their own solution and are fiendishly
delighted with how they have guaranteed their own job security
forever. I know who some of you are and I can say with some
confidence that when the Zombie apocalypse happens, no one is going
to invite you into their fortified compounds. <strong>We hate you that
much.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/environment.png" alt="image">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>
<h1>Pydanny Made Up Template Debate Statistics</h1>
<p>The made up statistics in this post frequently touch on contentious
topics. So let me add another controversial topic, this time the never
ending template debate in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% of python developers prefer
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/templates/">non-XML</a>
<a href="https://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">templates</a>.</li>
<li>25% of python developers prefer <a href="https://www.makotemplates.org/">XML</a>
templates.</li>
<li>5% of python developers wonder why we don't just use the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatstrings">str.format()</a>
method and be done with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The display for this data is a lovely pie chart as seen below. In order
to make it appear more useful, I made it a 3-D pie chart:</p>
<p><img src="/images/templates.png" alt="image">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>
<h1>Pydanny Made Up Python Web Optimization Statistics</h1>
<p>I sometimes get asked how to best optimize a Django site. My answer is
'optimize your queries and use caching'. On the other hand, there are
those who disagree with me and start switching out Django internals
before doing anything silly like looking at I/O. My bet is this same
thing happens with other frameworks such as Flask and Pyramid.</p>
<ul>
<li>20% developers argue switching template languages.</li>
<li>80% developers argue using caching and load balancing.</li>
<li>100% Django/Pyramid/Flask/etc core developers argue using caching
and load balancing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/optimization.png" alt="image">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>
<p>Of all the made up statistics in this blog post, I suspect this is the
one closest to the truth of things.</p>
<h1><span id="debate-statistics"></span>
<a href="#debate-statistics">Pydanny Made Up Debate Statistics</a></h1>
<p>Alright, let's conclude this article with some statistics I cooked up
in regards to various Python related topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>95% of developers trying to create reusable Python packages have
<strong>no freaking idea</strong> as to whether or not we should be using
setuptools, distribute, or distribute2 and wish there was a <strong>clear
explanation on the front page</strong> of PyPI as to what we should be
using and how. Something like a link to the <a href="https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Python Packaging User
Guide</a>
might be nice!</li>
<li>99% of us get frustrated with trying to reconcile the pronunciations
of PyPI with PyPy.</li>
<li>97.2% of our family and friends have no idea what Two Scoops of
Django is about.</li>
<li>62% of Python developers are wondering if Tulip will make their
projects more web scale.</li>
<li>49% of Twisted developers wish that Python had accepted their
standard instead of PEP-8.</li>
<li>42% of Python developers think Flask/Pyramid have awesome names that
don't get mispronounced the same way Django does.</li>
<li>28% of Python developers wish they could find a way to get some
SciPy into their projects.</li>
<li>23.6% of us get web.py and web2py confused with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>No chart? Getting this one to look meaningful was turning into a
herculean effort. I invite others to render this data into something
that look attractive and doesn't lose meaning. Come up with something
impressive and I'll put it into a follow-up blog post.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/travel-tips-for-geeks-preventing-theft"/>
        <updated>2013-07-18T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first in a set of blog posts based on my experiences
traveling in various places around the world. This particular
safety-related post is about theft, not scams, which I may cover in
another article.</p>
<p>For this first article, I'm hoping this gets on various technical RSS
feeds. I'm doing this because many of the readers of such feeds attend
conferences and are strangers in far and distant places.</p>
<h1>About Thieves</h1>
<p>Thieves (or pick pockets) are everywhere. I've seen extremely
suspicious activity in Portland, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Barcelona,
Florence, Pisa, and Krakow. Years ago in Washington DC I had stuff
stolen from me twice so I've been observant and careful ever since.
Anywhere there are non-residents distracted by looking at new vistas
while suffering from travel fatigue is where most thieves can be found.
I've learned a lot by observation and doing research but I don't claim
to be an expert. All I claim to be is someone who doesn't want to be
ripped off far from home.</p>
<h1>The Basics: Any place with tourists is risky</h1>
<p>While it can be said that thieves can be anywhere, the truth is that
they focus on where the tourists go. We carry money and expensive
things, are tired, distracted, and don't know our way around. For a
thief, A moment of risk can yield hundreds or thousands of dollars of
profit from a traveler.</p>
<h2>"I've never had any problems there"</h2>
<p>I've heard this several times from local residents or travelers, often
about places with statistically high crime rates. You'll hear it too.</p>
<p>All that means is that they've either been lucky or unobservant. It's
better to avoid a miserable trip by being a least a little careful with
your identity, money, and electronics.</p>
<h2>Listen to warnings before you go places</h2>
<p>In Barcelona our host warned us about La Rambla, a tourist-heavy street
that's notoriously thick with thieves. While we're always careful, we
were especially observant there, and enjoyed the very lovely and
friendly downtown Barcelona without incident.</p>
<p>Conversely, don't pay attention to warnings at locations. Public
notices about thieves are a nasty trap. When you see them you check your
most expensive things, giving away the location of money, jewelry,
watches, and cell phones.</p>
<h2>Watch how local residents protect themselves</h2>
<p>In suspicious places you'll notice local men with their hands in their
pockets. Why? It's because they are literally keeping their hands on
the money.</p>
<p>In the same places, local women will take a shirt, sweater, or even a
newspaper and have it on top of their purse with their arm on top of
that. Where "man-purses" are acceptable wear, men will do the same.</p>
<h2>Good thieves Look like tourists or non-criminals</h2>
<p>Some people or articles warn you about this or that ethnicity or how
people dress. That's not just racist and shallow, it's stupid and
inaccurate.</p>
<p>Thieves simply don't want to be noticed, and if noticed they want
escape to be as easy as possible. Which means the more active and
successful ones dress and act like everyone around you. Which means, for
example, in Europe the better thieves are of Caucasian descent and dress
like American visitors.</p>
<p>Do note that criminals from a non-majority ethnicity do exist, but they
aren't likely to be thieves. This is because being an ethnic minority
makes them easier to spot and track down. Also, the all-too-human
justice system is harsher on them. Instead, they are often the ones
preying on tourists by selling cheap, overpriced trinkets on the
sidewalks to tourists who often don't realize they are breaking local
laws by purchasing from them.</p>
<h2>Underage thieves are fearless</h2>
<p>Underage thieves have the benefit of that they don't have to worry
about the justice system. In many places the police can't arrest
children under a certain age and have to let them go. Also, if they are
caught, if they are in a gang, an older family member" will come up,
rebuke them publicly, and most people will let it go.</p>
<h1>An ounce of preperation...</h1>
<p>It's a good idea to spend a little time and money getting a few things
before you travel. Why? Cause here are the easiest targets in rough
order of ease for thieves (1 is super-easy, 7 is merely easy):</p>
<ol>
<li>Backbacks without locks worn on the back. <strong>Warning</strong>: Don't put
passports in your backback!</li>
<li>Fanny pack or wallet in the back pocket.</li>
<li>Grocery or store-purchase bag</li>
<li>Any outside-pocket cellphone holder.</li>
<li>Suitcases.</li>
<li>Wallet in the front pocket.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Don't be stupid</h2>
<p>At least one travel writer advocates putting your stuff in a local
grocery or store bag. That way you "fit in", thieves ignore you, and
you can confidently enjoy your visit.</p>
<p>This is <em>mind-bogglingly stupid</em>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Confidence means you allow yourself to be distracted.</li>
<li>Unless you live somewhere, you stand out.</li>
<li>Grocery or store bags are not designed to carry things for hours on
end. They break.</li>
<li>Grocery or store bags are one of the easiest target for thieves.
They either don't close adequately or are the perfect target for
razor armed thieves.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Your wallet</h2>
<p>Take your ID out and only keep a very small amount of money in your
wallet, which should be in your front pocket. Take the credit cards out
and put them in secret stashes. If you really want a credit card in your
wallet, get one linked to a bank account with just enough money for the
day in it. Add more money to it as you need.</p>
<h2>Shorten the Straps</h2>
<p>Keep the straps of your stuff short and in your hands. When walking next
to a street, keep bags on the far side from the road. Moped thieves will
will snatch and pull you until the straps break.</p>
<h2>Use secret stashes on your person</h2>
<p>Most sporting good stores sell money belts and underclothes pouches. Use
the money belt to store cash. Use an underclothes pouch to store your
passport and at least one credit card. For underclothes pouches I
recommend you open packages and feel the material against your skin.</p>
<h2>Consider buying anti-theft backpacks / laptop bags</h2>
<p>We prefer <strong>PacSafe</strong> brand gear because the clasps are hidden and
require a trick to open. Their stuff also has steel wire woven into
their straps and fabric, meaning they can't get cut by a razor. PacSafe
stuff isn't cheap but the peace of mind has been definitely worth the
price. We've relied on the PacSafe <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Metrosafe-Anti-Theft-Tablet-Laptop/dp/B00AVXDELI/?tag=ihpydanny-20">laptop
bag</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Luggage-Slingsafe-Shoulder-Black/dp/B006QLMDH0/?tag=ihpydanny-20">shoulder
bag</a>
for about 18 months now and they've been awesome.</p>

<h1>Identifying Thief Tactics</h1>
<p>Being a successful thief requires the same skills as a magician.
Observation, distraction, misdirection, staged audience members, and
timing are how they do it.</p>
<p>Here are some common techniques they use:</p>
<h2>The Big Local Attraction</h2>
<p>While you are gazing at the masterpiece of architecture, hungrily
peering at the door menu, or the incredible street performance, your
focus is off your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Train yourself so when you start to feel distracted to put
your arm or hand on your most expensive stuff.</p>
<h2>The Magician</h2>
<p>For reference, this is literally the same sort of sleight-of-hand that
magicians use.</p>
<p>Pickpockets often have a newspaper, expensive jacket, or nice sweater in
one hand to block what they are doing. While they engage you in friendly
conversation they use the prop to block your like of sight from their
other hand, which is busy. Especially good thieves don't even bother
with the props and just rely on the width of their arm to block lines of
observation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: If someone you don't know shows something up close to
you, back off. In fact, just apologize and keep your distance. It's
perfectly okay to not follow "local custom".</p>
<h2>The Spill</h2>
<p>If anyone throws anything at you, or if something is spilled on you, the
thief helps you clean up, their accomplice is going through your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Back up and start screaming "Help, Thief" because it
means you've been targeted and are under active scam. Cover your stuff
with your arms and hands.</p>
<h2>The Fall</h2>
<p>This one is hard to deal with, especially for me.</p>
<p>If a person falls or stumbles around you, don't help them, regardless
of their age or apparent infirmity. While you help them their accomplice
is taking from you.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Unless there is obvious injury, back off and let the
locals take care of it, or find the police.</p>
<h2>The Gift</h2>
<p>This year the new trick is for someone to ask you if you want them to
take pictures of you using your camera or cell phone. You hand them your
camera and they start running. <em>You've literally 'gifted' them your
camera!</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Look for someone to take your picture, never the other way
around.</p>
<h2>Your Room</h2>
<p>While staying at a hotel/hostel/BnB you go out for the day in a place
without a safe. When you come back your valuables are gone.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: No safe? Carry your valuables!</p>
<h1>If you catch a thief</h1>
<p>You've caught them in the act. Maybe you've grabbed them or maybe they
started running. Follow these steps to avoid injury and even death.</p>
<h2>DON'T CHASE THIEVES</h2>
<p>Whatever you do, don't chase thieves. Thieves of all ages are usually
in gangs or have friends nearby. Their 'backup' carry weapons ranging
from sticks to knives to guns. People die from chasing thieves every
year in every country. Nothing you are carrying is worth your life.</p>
<h2>Call for help</h2>
<p>Learn how to yell "<em>Help, Thief!</em>" in the local language. Often the
locals may deal with it as they hate thieves since crime damages their
businesses and local reputation. In fact sometimes the response is
overwhelmingly violent. There are stories of would-be victims in Africa,
India, and Europe intervening to save the life of a would-be thief's
life.</p>
<h2>The Police</h2>
<p>It's pretty universal police who deal with street crime wear uniforms.
Work with them and if they ask you if you want to press charges, do so.
Otherwise in many places they have to let the person go.</p>
<h2>DANGER: The 'undercover' police</h2>
<p>Anyone not wearing a uniform and claiming to be 'undercover' is an
accomplice, scam artist, or worse. If they 'come to help':</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't give up any identification.</li>
<li>Demand that uniformed police be summoned by radio or phone to this
location immediately. If the 'undercover' police refuse, then they
are a scam or worse.</li>
<li><strong>Don't leave the spot!</strong> If 'undercover' police try to get you
to come with them, refuse loudly. If they try to force you away,
start yelling as if your life is in danger, <strong>because it is</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>In Closing</h1>
<p>Theft is real. Go to Youtube and spent 10 minutes searching on "thief"
or "pickpocket" for proof. Most of the videos are surveillance videos,
but when magicians talk about theft it's pretty fun to watch.</p>
<p>In any case, it's easy to dramatically decrease your chances of being a
victim of this kind of crime by being prepared and vigilant.</p>

of working with Python 3 (with or without Django).</p>
<p>Recently I've become involved in a couple of Django efforts that used
Python 3.3. The quick summary of what I learned is pretty much what I
expected: Out of the box Django 1.5 (and the pending 1.6 release) works
fine with Python 3.3.2.</p>
<h1>Use Python 3.3.2!</h1>
<p>Myself and others have encountered problems with using Django 1.5+ and
earlier versions of Python 3. The issues can be tricky; for example
<code>syncdb</code> fails in curious ways on Python 3.3.0.</p>
<p>The answer, for me, is to use Python 3.3.2 and don't look back.</p>
<h1>Checking for Python 3 Compatibility</h1>
<p>The steps I use are below. They are in rough order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up the package on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/">PyPI</a> and see
if any of it's trove classifiers mention Python 3 status.</li>
<li>See if a pull request for Python 3 support is outstanding.</li>
<li>Run the test suite using Python 3.3</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html">2to3</a> to scan the
code for issues.</li>
<li>If a Django project, check the models for <code>__str__()</code> methods. If it
has them, it's a pretty good indicator it's Python 3.3 friendly.</li>
<li>Make a judgement call.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Important Packages that work with Python 3</h1>
<p>In this section I'm listing a few of the Python and Django packages
I'm using that worked without me having to do anything sort of
modification or pull request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django 1.5 and 1.6 beta</li>
<li>Pillow (drop-in replacement for PIL)</li>
<li>South</li>
<li>django-bootstrap-registration (templates for django-registration)</li>
<li>django-braces</li>
<li>django-crispy-forms</li>
<li>requests</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conversion process</h1>
<p>How I convert Python 2 code to Python 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 2to3 until you get used to not using it.</li>
<li>Fix any problems you find in the code. Try to keep solutions as
simple as possible.</li>
<li>Submit the pull request.</li>
<li>Politely poke the package owner to accept the pull request.</li>
<li>Once the owner accepts the pull request, gently poke the package
owner to push the update to PyPI.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Packages that needed conversion</h1>
<p>Here are four packages worth noting that had to be converted:</p>
<ul>
<li>unicode-slugify</li>
<li>django-registration</li>
<li>django-stripe-payments (in progress)</li>
<li>django-nose</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get into some detail for each package:</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-slugify">unicode-slugify</a></h2>
<p>This is a handy, more unicode friendly replacement for Django's
django.utils.text.slugify function. It failed on Django 1.6 beta, so I
forked it, submitted a successful pull request after testing it on
Python 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3.2. The Mozilla team pushed it to PyPI
and even gave me
<a href="https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/profile/pydanny">badges</a> for
my efforts!</p>
<p>In the future I would like to see this little package work without the
dependency of Django itself, and I've had a couple replacement
dependencies suggested.</p>
<h2>django-registration</h2>
<p>With the 1.0 release, it's been updated for Django 1.5, <em>unless</em> you
use customized User models or Python 3. I really needed this on PyPI,
but the maintainer is very busy. Therefore, I forked the project,
renamed it to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-reg">django-reg</a>
while referencing the original, and pushed it to PyPI. Not ideal, but
sometimes you have to do what you have to do.</p>
<p>Lesson learned: In the future skip these issues and just use
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-allauth">django-allauth</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 08/08/2013</strong>: All my Python 3 work is now on django-allauth.
This way I don't have to do the work of maintaining a compatibility
branch.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-stripe-payments">django-stripe-payments</a> (in progress)</h2>
<p>While django-zebra is better known for handling stripe payments, I
prefer to use Eldarion's excellent, well-maintained and tested
django-stripe-payments. It was delayed because django-nose wasn't
Python 3 compatible, but that's been fixed as of at least 7/28/2013.
Unfortunately, it's Travis-CI tests fail with the Django 1.5 era custom
user model because of what might be a linter misconfiguration. In
theory, the just released version of pylint (1.0) should work without
any problems.</p>
<p>Of course, I informed the maintainers of my efforts and problems.</p>
<p><strong>Update 07/30/2013</strong>: Updated the text to reflect the current status of
the linter problems I'm having.</p>
<p><strong>Update 08/08/2013</strong>: While django-stripe-payments is useful, it
doesn't do everything that I need. I tried extending it's logic into a
third app, but that was proving unweildy. Therefore, I forked the
project to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dj-stripe">dj-stripe</a>, which
has the features and compatibility that I need.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nose">django-nose</a></h2>
<p>Today, I asked the maintainer to visit an outstanding pull request that
adds Python 3 compatibility. It's a good idea to do this since they
might already be working on it, or may have observations they want to
share.</p>
<p><strong>Update 7/28/2013</strong>: Jeff Balogh pushed a Python 3.3.2+ compatible
version up to PyPI a few days ago. Makes everything so much better!</p>
<h1>Dealing with Slow Maintainers</h1>
<p>For what it's worth, from experience ranting to or about slow-moving
maintainers is absolutely counter-productive. People have lives and jobs
that sometimes get in the way of open source. It's more productive to
be patient, be polite, and if necessary do an absolutely minimal fork or
find a working alternative.</p>
<h1>Handy Resources</h1>
<p>The following are two useful resources on converting Python 2 to Python
3. I don't follow their methods exactly, I just use them as rough
guidelines for my own workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/cJMGvAYYUyY">Porting Django apps to Python 3</a> video
by Jacob Kaplan-Moss</li>
<li><a href="https://python3porting.com/">Porting to Python 3</a> book (free HTML or
paid PDF, Kindle, ePub) by Lennart Regebro</li>
</ul>
<p>For various Python 3 recipes, I keep my kindle reader open to this
priceless gem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B00DQV4GGY/?tag=ihpydanny">Python Cookbook, 3rd
Edition</a>
book by David Beazley and Brian K. JOnes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>This blog post makes it seems like I've put in a lot of work getting
things to Python 3, but that isn't the case at all. In fact, for the
most part the transition has been trivial. There are a few minor
hiccups, but nothing that's killing a whole day or destroying a
deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit of using Python 3?</strong> I get to call myself a <strong>Python 3
Hipster</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Downside of using Python 3?</strong> A little bit of extra homework on each
project. However, each time I fix something it's done and I've made
the world a better place.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/core-concepts-django-modelforms"/>
        <updated>2013-06-13T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my opinion, the concepts behind Django's model forms can be listed
in just six (6) bullets. The bullets I've marked in <strong>bold</strong> at the top
are the topic of this blog post, while the two of these that were
<a href="/core-concepts-django-forms.html">covered in a previous blog post on Django
forms</a> are at
bottom of my list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML.</strong></li>
<li><strong>ModelForms select validators based off of Model field
definitions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>ModelForms don't have to display/change all available fields.</strong></li>
<li><strong>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables.</strong></li>
<li>Forms are "just" Python constructs. (covered previous)</li>
<li>Forms validate Python dictionaries. (covered previous)</li>
</ul>
<h1>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML.</h1>
<p>If I create a Django model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
</code></pre>
<p>Then attach it to a ModelForm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:

        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<p>I can render it in a template, or for better clarity in this post, the
Python REPL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm
>>> mf = MyModelForm()
>>> mf
&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>
>>> print(mf)
&#x3C;tr>&#x3C;th>&#x3C;label for="id_title">Title:&#x3C;/label>&#x3C;/th>
&#x3C;td>&#x3C;input id="id_title" name="title" maxlength="100" type="text" />&#x3C;/td>&#x3C;/tr>
</code></pre>
<h1>ModelForms select validators based off of Model field definitions.</h1>
<p>One of the nice things about Django is that its forms library protects
your models. It does this by assigning one or more of Django's many
built-in validators to the form fields it generates, and using them to
check incoming data. Let's dive in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm
>>> mf = MyModelForm()
>>> mf
&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>
>>> mf.fields
{'title': &#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x102474bd0>}
>>> field = mf.fields['title']
>>> field.max_length
100
>>> field.validators
[&#x3C;django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator object at 0x102403b10>]
</code></pre>
<p>Each individual field contains a list of validators (in this case, just
one validator) supplied by Django and any ModelForm customizations that
might have been done.</p>
<p>If you want to add more validators to a ModelForm (perhaps we want our
title field to require at least 20 characters) one way to do it is by
overriding the field definition in the ModelForm class's <code>__init__</code>
method. That's a mouthful, so I'll just demonstrate in code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)     
        self.fields["title"].min_length = 20
        self.fields["title"].validators.append(MinLengthValidator)

    class Meta:

        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<p>If we stop/start the shell, we now see some new elements added to the
form object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> # Don't forget to stop/start the Django shell!
>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm
>>> mf = MyModelForm()
>>> mf
&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>
>>> mf.fields
{'title': &#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x1023ee810>}
>>> field = mf.fields['title']
>>> field.max_length
100
>>> field.min_length
20
>>> field.validators
[&#x3C;django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator object at 0x10240c7d0>, &#x3C;django.core.validators.MinLengthValidator object at 0x1023eef90>]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two validators for the field!</p>
<p>There are other ways to override the title field validators. The easiest
but not necessarily the best way is to replicate the ModelForm
definition of the field in the form like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    title = forms.CharField(max_length=100, min_length=20)

    class Meta:

        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<p>I don't like this technique. This makes it so we are defining the title
field in two places, once in the model and once in the form. I go into
more of the details and problems of this approach in my previous blog
post at <a href="/overloading-form-fields.html">Overloading Django Form
Fields</a>.</p>
<h1>ModelForms don't have to display/change all available fields.</h1>
<p>Before we dive into this section, let's increase our model to have two
fields as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    slug = models.SlugField()
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say that we don't want to allow users the ability to change
slugs on existing content, otherwise URLs will be broken. In this case,
we rely on the <code>fields</code> attribute of <code>ModelForm.Meta</code> to make it so we
only display what we want to display:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:

        model = MyModel
        fields = ('title', )
</code></pre>
<p>Easy!</p>
<h2>But what about ModelForm.Meta.excludes?</h2>
<p>We advocate strongly against using <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>.</p>
<p>In fact, when we were writing <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two Scoops of
Django</a> the majority of our technical
reviewers as well as our security reviewer fervently insisted that we
advocate against use of <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>. We provide numerous
warnings about it's usage, and go in-depth as to why in <em>section
21.12</em>. For reference, Django's own documentation is now including a
rather mild warning (no warning box) on the subject at <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelforms-selecting-fields">selecting the
fields to
use</a>.
I might try and get that addressed in the next few days...</p>
<p>In any case, the problem with <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code> is similar to
but worse than duplicating field functionality. It means that changes to
models (new fields for example) will display in associated forms
<strong>unless</strong> you remember to modify the associated forms. Since a single
model can have multiple forms, and we developers forget or leave
projects, you can understanding what sort of security nightmare this can
cause.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and stay away from <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>.</p>
<h1>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables</h1>
<p>In my <a href="/core-concepts-django-forms.html">previous post of Django
forms</a> I covered
<em>forms validate dictionaries</em>. Well, ModelForms do the same thing AND
give us the power to save that validated dictionary to SQL tables. We
don't even need to involve web pages!</p>
<p>This is really useful because it means that we can take data from any
source, be it user input from the web, JSON data fetched from an API,
and even CSVs generated from Excel reports and transform that into data
that resides in SQL.</p>
<p>Let's go over using our ModelForm with title/slug fields used with all
those methods. In our samples (web page, json, csv), we'll use
generating a timestamp to demonstrate how we can modify the model data
before it's saved, and we'll base all three examples off the model and
ModelForm combination listed below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/models.py
from django.db import models


class MyModel(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import Forms

from .models import MyModel


class MyModel(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:

        model = MyModel
        fields = ('title', )
</code></pre>
<p>And now to our three examples!</p>
<h2>Example #1 Web Page</h2>
<p>This should look pretty familiar to many Django developers. it's the
traditional Django view pattern of processing simple model forms.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/views.py
from django.core.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django import forms
from django.utils import timezone

from .forms import MyModelForm


def add_model(request):

    if request.method == "POST":
        form = MyModelForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():

            # commit=False means the form doesn't save at this time.
            # commit defaults to True which means it normally saves.
            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)
            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()
            model_instance.save()
            return redirect('victory')
    else:
        form = MyModelForm()

    return render(request, "my_template.html", {'form': form})
</code></pre>
<h2>Example #2 API/JSON</h2>
<p>In this example, we're validating the output of a RESTful API before
letting it touch our database. It's critical that such APIs are not
allowed to touch our systems without proper validation - don't make my
mistakes! Also, even internally within a project it's really important
to validate all data coming from different databases. And Django makes
it easy!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/api/reitz.py
from django.utils import timezone

import requests  # You are using requests-python, right?

from .forms import MyModelForm


class ReitzApiException(Exception):
    pass


def fetch_reitz_data(target_url):
    response = requests.get(target_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:

        # generate the form from the response
        form = MyModelForm(response.json())
        if form.is_valid():
            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)
            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()
            model_instance.save()
            return model_instance

        # Simplistic exception handling
        raise ReitzApiException(form.errors)

    # Simplistic exception handling
    raise ReitzApiException(response.status_code)
</code></pre>
<h2>Example #3 CSV Import</h2>
<p>I'll admit my mistake again: I've written my own validation tools to
handle data coming from CSVs and Excel documents into Django projects.
My validation scripts always seem fragile, and they are. What I'm doing
going forward is I'm leaning on form libraries to do the hard work of
validating data and saving it to models.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import csv

from django.utils import timezone

from .forms import MyModelForm


def import_csv(filename):
    rows = open(filename)
    records_added = 0
    errors = []
    # Generate a dict per row, with the first CSV row being the keys.
    for row in csv.DictReader(rows, delimiter=","):

        # Bind the row data to the MyModelForm
        form = MyModelForm(row)
        if form.is_valid():
            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)
            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()
            model_instance.save()
            records_added += 1
        else:
            errors.append(form.errors)

    return records_added, errors
</code></pre>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>I can think of three things:</p>
<p><strong>Forget the HTML</strong>: For nearly every sort of occasion where new data is
coming into your system, form libraries save you from doing extra work
and cover your behind. While my experience is with Django forms, there
are many form libraries out there. The patterns explored in this post
are certainly available in other web frameworks (see
<a href="https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/category/forms/">https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/category/forms/</a> for proof).</p>
<p><strong>HTML Rendering Issues</strong>: No form library is going to do everything,
and because of evolving standards, decent HTML rendering is a pain for
form library authors. For example, Django's default form HTML rendering
remains stuck in 2005 because if they had kept up with modern trends of
HTML form layout we would have many different flavors of forms in Django
core (a testing nightmare). Which means, as a developer, it's important
when using a new form library to learn how to override the default form
HTML rendering.</p>
<p><strong>What about AJAX?</strong>: Whoops! Does this mean I have to write another
blog post? Not at all. In Django, AJAX is just another view, either
function- or class-based. The secret is to validate the incoming data
the same way as you would any other view request by using forms.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because of the ubiquitousness of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restructured_Text">reStructuredText</a> in
the lives of <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> developers and the advocacy of
it, it's not uncommon for people to assume we used it to write our
book. However, that's not really the case.</p>
<p>The short answer is we used:</p>
<ul>
<li>reStructuredText (RST)</li>
<li>Google Documents</li>
<li>Apple Pages</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/LateX">LaTeX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The long answer is the rest of this posting. Since writing the book was
broken up into three major stages '<em>alpha</em>', '<em>beta</em>', and
'<em>final</em>', so have I broken up blog article.</p>
<h1>Alpha Days</h1>
<p>Some of the original alpha material was written in rough draft form as
RST since it was what we were used to using. Unfortunately, the PDF
generation wasn't to our liking, so we immediately began looking at
other options. Since she enjoyed using it at MIT and because it gave us
greater individual control, <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a> wanted to
switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/LateX">LaTeX</a>. I was worried
about the challenges of learning LaTeX, so we compromised and moved to
Google Documents.</p>
<p>For the most part, Google Documents was great in the early stages. The
real-time collaborative nature was handy, but the gem was the comment
system. It gave us the ability to have line-by-line written dialogues
with our technical reviewers. However, Google Documents makes it
nigh-impossible to use WYSIWYG editor styles, add in better print fonts,
forced us to cut-and-paste code examples, and finally the PDF export
system was flakey on our massive document.</p>
<p>Our original thought was to convert the Google Document output to PDF
and then modify it with Adobe InDesign. Upon trying it, we found it had
a lackluster user interface that had a steep learning curve and was
prohibitively expensive ($550-$700). Our friend and reviewer, Kenneth
Love of <a href="https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com">Getting Started with
Django</a> fame, offered to do the
conversion work, but we wanted to be able to update our work at will.
Awesome as Kenneth might be, we couldn't expect him to drop what he was
doing to update the final output of our work whenever we wanted.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we did in the week of January 10th-16th was convert the
book to Apple Pages, which is the word processor in Apple iWorks. This
was as painful as it sounds. We also discovered the day before launch
that Apple Pages doesn't create a sidebar PDF table of contents, which
a lot of people enjoy (including ourselves). Tired and exhausted from
weeks of 16 hour days, we launched anyway on January 17th with the book
weighing in at 5.1 MB.</p>
<h1>Beta Experiences</h1>
<p>People were so positive it really gave us a boost. Hundreds of people
sent us feedback and we were delighted beyond words, with a significant
portion sending us commentary/corrections about our writing and code.
I'll admit I did get tired over a certain 'moat' mistake since I got
corrected on it over 50 times. However, the number of code corrections
we were getting was higher than expected. It was clear we needed to be
able to import the code modules from testable chunks of real code. We
had so many kindle/epub requests we also needed the ability to render
the text attractively across multiple formats.</p>
<p>After stumbling through RST, Google Documents, and Apple Pages different
tools, I finally agreed with Audrey that the challenges of learning
LaTeX was worth it. While we could have used RST, we would have had to
use LaTeX anyway for our customizations since when RST is converted to
PDF it actually uses an interim step of LaTeX!</p>
<p>So while I handled the corrections and feedback from thousands, Audrey
built the fundamentals of the LaTeX file structure. Audrey really got
her hands dirty by teaching me LaTeX, since my brain is slow and thick.
Here's a sample of what I've learned how to do, taken from Chapter 6,
Section 1, Subsection 5 (6.1.5):</p>
<pre><code class="language-latex">\subsection{Model Inheritance in Practice: The TimeStampedModel}
It's very common in Django projects to include a \inlinecode{created} and \inlinecode{modified} timestamp field on all your models. We could manually add those fields to each and every model, but that's a lot of work and adds the risk of human error. A better solution is to write a \inlinecode{TimeStampedModel} \index{TimeStampedModel} to do the work for us:

\goodcodefile{chapter_06/myapp/core/timestampedmodel.py}

Take careful note of the very last two lines in the example, which turn our example into an abstract base class: \index{abstract base classes}

\goodcodefile{chapter_06/myapp/core/class_meta.py}

By defining \inlinecode{TimeStampedModel} as an abstract base class \index{abstract base classes} when we define a new class that inherits from it, Django doesn't create a \inlinecode{model\_utils.time\_stamped\_model} table when syncdb is run.
</code></pre>
<p>Once I got the hang of LaTeX, then began the hard work of converting the
book's current content from Apple Pages. That was a couple weeks of
grueling effort on my part while Audrey wrote more book material. Daily
I would request a new LaTeX customizations, which Audrey would address.
However, as she was working on literally rewriting the content of a
dozen chapters including templates, testing, admin, and logging my
interruptions became an issue. So we enlisted the help of Italian
economist and LaTeX expert Laura Gelsomino. Thanks to her the desired
text formatting was achieved.</p>
<p>During the conversion process we rewrote every single code example,
putting them into easily testable projects, and pulled them into the
book via use of custom LaTeX commands called <code>\goodcodefile{}</code> and
<code>\badcodefile{}</code>.</p>
<p>Eventually I joined Audrey on rewriting and reviewing chapters and on
February 28th, the beta was launched. LaTeX generates lean PDFs so the
book came in at just 1.6 MB while adding a whopping 50 pages (25% more)
of content.</p>
<h1>Final Efforts</h1>
<p>The final effort was focused on cleanup, new formats, presentation, and
art.</p>
<p>For cleanup, our amazing readers gave us so much feedback we could
barely keep up. We fought to keep our dialogues with them personal yet
brief. With reader oversight we corrected many of the 'quirks' of my
writing style (Audrey is a stickler for Strunk and White, I am not). We
also made numerous corrections based on feedback and our own
observations.</p>
<p>With the guidance of fellow Python author <a href="https://hairysun.com/">Matt
Harrison</a> I wrote scripts that took the archaic
HTML generated by LaTeX module tex4ht and rendered it into something
that Kindlegen could use to generate Kindle .mobi files. At first the
results looked awesome on modern kindles and other new ebook readers,
but was terrible on older devices. So I toned back the fancy stuff to
what you see today. Getting technical books to look nice on all readers
is really, really hard - and unfortunately some publishers take
shortcuts that hurt the efforts of the authors. If you have problem with
an e-book's format, please consider that before writing a negative
review about the final output.</p>
<p>Speaking of mobile editions, we also wrote a second version of each
Python example to deal with the smaller format. While libraries exist to
do the work for you, since I did a lot of it from scratch (albeit
coached by Matt) I had to dig into the lackluster .mobi/.epub
documentation to figure out things like .ncx files.</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> If you want to be the self-published author of a technical
book I <em>strongly recommend</em> you read Matt's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ebook-Formatting-Mobi-EPUB-ebook/dp/B00BWQXHU6/ref=la_B0077BQLH6_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366041987&#x26;sr=1-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">Ebook Formatting: KF8,
Mobi &#x26;
EPUB</a>.
Also check out his rst2epub2 library for converting RST files to various
formats.</p>
<p>While I worked on the mobile editions, Audrey focused on the print
version and adding more art and bits and pieces of new content. She
focused on clarity and flow, and the result is that the book feels even
lighter to read and yet is dense with useful information. To test how
the book launched, she would order a copy from the printer and wait
several days for it to arrive. Then she would inspect the cover and
interior with her incredibly exacting eye. It's a slow process, but
Audrey wanted to make absolutely certain our readers would enjoy and use
the print edition.</p>
<p>On April 10th we launched the final in PDF, Kindle, and ePub form. The
PDF weighs in at 2.7 MB, and the Kindle file is a bit heaver. At some
point we'll do the work to reduce file size, but for now we're working
on other things.</p>
<p>A week later we announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">print version of the
book</a>.
People seem to really like the design and feel of the physical book, and
we've even had requests for t-shirts.</p>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>Writing a technical book was really hard. Crazy hard. Also very
satisfying. We could have made more money doing just client work, but
this was a dream come true. Sometimes money doesn't matter.</p>
<h2>Whither Two Scoops of Django?</h2>
<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.5</a> will still receive periodic corrections,
but won't see new content unless it's security related for Django 1.5.
Don't worry though, for when Django 1.6 comes nigh, we'll commence
work on Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django <strong>1.6</strong> (<strong>TSD
1.6</strong>). The plan is to update practices as needed and hopefully add more
content on testing, logging, continuous integration, and more. Like
it's predecessor TSD 1.6 will be written using LaTeX.</p>
<p>That said, if I ever fulfill my dream of writing fiction I'll just use
Matt Harrison's <a href="https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2epub2">rst2epub2</a>
library.</p>
<h2>Concerns About Open Sourcing</h2>
<p>We've considered open sourcing our current book generation system, but
installation is rather challenging and requires serious
Audrey/Laura-level LaTeX knowledge combined with my experience with
Python. Unfortunately, from our experience on managing other open source
projects, dealing with requests for documentation and assistance would
take up a prohibitive amount of our time. Honestly, we would rather
write another book or sling code.</p>
<h2>Book Generation as a Service?</h2>
<p>Another option is turning our system into a service, which would convert
existing RST or even MarkDown to LaTeX so it could generate books in the
Two Scoops format. Doing this would require at least a month of
full-time work on both of our parts, and we have no idea as to the
interest level. We think it would be a low amount of interest, but then
again, hasn't <a href="https://leanpub.com">leanpub</a> done pretty well using this
model of business?</p>
<p>In any case we're working on other projects. Maybe even a new technical
book...</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've heard good things about filepicker.io, which is a service that
makes file uploading a much better experience. Unfortunately, the Django
package for filepicker.io doesn't work with South. When I try to create
a migration using the filepicker.io field using code like the
following...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># products/models.py
from django.db import models
from django_filepicker.models import FPFileField

class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file = FPFileField(upload_to='uploads')
</code></pre>
<p>...when I try to run the command:</p>
<pre><code>(tsd)$ python manage.py schemamigration products --initial
</code></pre>
<p>It results in this unpleasant looking response:</p>
<pre><code>(tsd)$ python manage.py schemamigration products --initial
Creating migrations directory at '/Users/danielgreenfeld/code/tsp/tsp/products/migrations'...
Creating __init__.py in '/Users/danielgreenfeld/code/tsp/tsp/products/migrations'...
 ! Cannot freeze field 'products.product.fpfile'
 ! (this field has class django_filepicker.models.FPFileField)
 ! Cannot freeze field 'products.release.fpfile'
 ! (this field has class django_filepicker.models.FPFileField)

 ! South cannot introspect some fields; this is probably because they are custom
 ! fields. If they worked in 0.6 or below, this is because we have removed the
 ! models parser (it often broke things).
 ! To fix this, read https://south.aeracode.org/wiki/MyFieldsDontWork
</code></pre>
<p>The last line in the error report is important. I'll repeat it to
illustrate it more clearly:</p>
<pre><code>! To fix this, read https://south.aeracode.org/wiki/MyFieldsDontWork
</code></pre>
<p>Experience working on other projects has taught me I can simply add two
lines of code to <code>products/models.py</code> and everything should just work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># South migration rules for the FPFileField field
from south.modelsinspector import add_introspection_rules
add_introspection_rules([], ["django_filepicker.models.FPFileField"])
</code></pre>
<p>In case it's not clear, here's my new <code>products/models.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># products/models.py
from django.db import models
from django_filepicker.models import FPFileField

# South migration rules for the FPFileField field
from south.modelsinspector import add_introspection_rules
add_introspection_rules([], ["django_filepicker.models.FPFileField"])

class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file = FPFileField(upload_to='uploads')
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can create South migrations and they'll just work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem is that for any model where I need to use
filepicker's FPFileField I need to add those two lines of code. I
don't like this approach, since it violates <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>
(DRY).</p>
<p>At some point I'll demonstrate how to fix this violation of DRY with an
easy fix. In fact, I plan submit that fix as a pull request to
django-filepicker.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013/12/24:</strong> django-filepicker has been patched to address
this issue. This blog post therefore describes a historical version of
the package.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like I'm dreaming, but <strong>we're on our way to Europe!</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a> and I decided to move. While
looking at possible rentals or even mortgages, we were idly (dreaming
really... still paying off debts incurred from last year) looking at
how much a room/apartment would cost to rent in Europe. To our surprise,
we found a lot of good options that cost less then it would to pay
monthly rent/mortgage in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>o_O</strong></p>
<p>Then, we discovered an amazing travel deal. It combined a very cheap
red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, and a slow
trans-atlantic ship from Port Miami to Barcelona, about as much as a
cheap hotel but with free food! If we avoid alcohol and any extra fees,
it's actually extremely inexpensive. Being mostly disconnected from the
internet would mean we could really focus on a couple of critical
projects. If only we had a business justification for going to
Europe...</p>
<p><strong>It just so happens that we have business in Europe.</strong></p>
<p>Our plan is to spend a few months in Europe before returning back to the
USA. We'll work hard on the ship, work hard when we arrive, and just
get stuff done. It's not a vacation, but it is Europe, and there is
such a thing as weekends.</p>
<p>We'll be spending a few days in early May in Barcelona, then making our
way to Poland for several weeks. Yes, we're attending <a href="https://djangocircus.com">Django
Circus</a>, plus I want to investigate some family
roots. After Poland, we're thinking either France, Italy, Hungary,
England, Belgium, Scotland, Ireland, and other options. We'll see where
the winds and affordable AirBNB places take us.</p>
<p>When do we go back? Well, we plan to stay for at least two months. Even
if we go back to the USA, we would have at least been in Europe for May
and June. How cool is that?</p>
<p>We could have talked ourselves out of going. We nearly did. However,
even with our workload this is the chance of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Finally, for the next two weeks I'll only be able to access the
internet for a few minutes per day. Please expect my responses to emails
and tweets to be slower than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the middle of all of this, I was invited to keynote
Django Circus:

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I was a child I wanted to be a published author. I've dreamt of
people reading my book. While one could say that dream was fulfilled
when we launched the e-book version in January, it's not the same as
seeing the printed copy. Today I got to see my dream come true, a
printed
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>
is out there with my name on it.</p>
<p>Also, I have a confession to make. When it comes to technical books, I
really prefer the print version. For me, nothing beats being able to
flip through pages of a hardcopy next to a keyboard, or simply reading
while I'm on a bus, train, or plane. So this adds to my excitement when
I get to say that the book that <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">Audrey Roy</a> and
I wrote together is in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">print</a>.</p>
<p>Note: As of April 17th it's only available in the US. However, it's in
the queue for being available for Amazon Europe. Enough people are
asking that we are also looking into getting it bulk shipped to <a href="https://djangocircus.com/">Django
Circus</a>.</p>
<p>While it's been an amazing journey, it's also been a long hard road.
Starting with a late night dinner with <a href="https://rdegges.com">Randall
Degges</a>, his wife
<a href="https://hardlyfunny.com">Samantha</a>, and <a href="https://bravoflix.com/">Sean
Bradley</a>, to spending hours upon hours writing
and revising, to taking painfully honest critiques from mentors, to
alpha launch, then rewriting the book followed by the beta launch. It
wasn't easy, but the growing volume of positive feedback and
suggestions from readers kept us going.</p>
<p>Between the Alpha and Beta releases we switched over to LaTeX. Audrey
taught it to me in February, and I'm proud to say I've progressed from
absolute neophyte to beginner. We chose it because of it's fine-grained
control over layout for the PDF and print versions. Creating the Kindle
and ePub versions from LaTeX was harder thanks to using LaTeX, but
everything's automated now so making updates is easy. Future editions
of this
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>
(1.6, 1.7, etc) or other technical books I hope to write will continue
to be in LaTeX, but if I publish fiction I'll probably go with
RestructuredText.</p>
<p>While working on the final version we were greatly saddened by the death
of Malcolm Tredennick, to whom the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>
is dedicated. We miss him terribly. I've tried to write about
Malcolm's volume of his contribution to the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>,
but it's still too hard. For now, let's just say that he gave and
taught us so much and asked us for nothing in return, which is why we
continue to give free copies of the PDF edition of the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>
to developers in need, as well as try to stay in contact with all
recipients of the free PDF.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are a developer in need, and can't afford a copy, drop
us a note at <a href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a> explaining your situation. Our
quick rule of thumb is that if you can afford to buy games for your
favorite device, then you can afford to buy our
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">book</a>.
Also, please do your friends a favor and don't just give them a copy
without having them ask us. Why not? Well, <strong>we update the book
frequently, and have a strong commitment for adding security related
content</strong> even now that the final edition is out.</p>
<p>What now? Well, we aren't certain. We're maintaining a couple client
projects but aren't taking on new ones. We've got a couple projects
we're working on and I'm talking employment with a couple companies
who do good things for the community.</p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ebook-Formatting-Mobi-EPUB-ebook/dp/B00BWQXHU6/ref=la_B0077BQLH6_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366041987&#x26;sr=1-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">Ebook Formatting: KF8, Mobi &#x26;
EPUB</a>,
we managed to create pretty decent looking Kindle and ePub versions of
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/">Two Scoops of Django</a>.</p>
<p>One of many things we did was focus on providing an excellent table of
contents. Of course we provided one inside the content of the book, but
much like the PDF version we also provided one that various ebook
readers can display in sidebars or drop down menus. Unfortunately,
building this navigation isn't well documented (except for Matt's
book), and I've yet to see any good ways to generate it via code.</p>
<p>Which is why I present the following code. It looks at the HTML that
KindleGen and ePub generators demand and pulls from it a chapter-based
table of contents. Then constructs a .ncx file, which is what ebook
readers use to generate the sidebar/dropdown table of contents.</p>
<p>Our requirements:</p>
<pre><code>Jinja2
Django
BeautifulSoup4
</code></pre>
<p>And now the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from django.utils.text import slugify
from jinja2 import Template

TEMPLATE = Template("""&#x3C;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    # Grab the base file for review
    with open(filename) as f:
        text = f.read()

    # load the text into a bs4 object
    soup = BeautifulSoup(text)

    # grab the nav element
    nav = soup.find("nav")

    # loop through the TOC for chapters. 
    # Sections/Subsections can't be displayed, so don't worry about them
    # li.chapter is how we constructed our TOC. Your mileage may vary.
    chapters = []
    for li in nav.find_all("li", "chapter"):
        chapters.append(dict(
            href=li.a['href'],
            string=li.a.text,
            slug=slugify(li.a.string)
        ))

    # Render the template
    template = TEMPLATE.render(chapters=chapters)

    # convert to ASCII
    template = template.encode("ascii", "xmlcharrefreplace")

    # Save to the toc.ncx
    with open("toc.ncx", "w") as f:
        f.write(template)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main('book.html')
</code></pre>
<p>There is more to adding a table of contents then just this simple
module. You also have to construct the .opf file, which is another
undocumented mess that I'll blog about.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/fixing-pythons-string-class"/>
        <updated>2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever wonder why Python's <code>str</code> or <code>unicode</code> types lack obvious length
methods? Yes, we can get the length via the special <code>__len__()</code> method,
but instead as Python developers we get the so-called 'luxury' of
discovering length via the Python's built-in <code>len()</code> function. So
instead of calling the length of objects the way Rubyists or
Javascripters do...</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">>> # ruby
>> s = "Hello, World!"
=> "Hello, World!"
>> s.length
13
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// javascript
var s = "Hello, world!"
console.log(s.length)
13
</code></pre>
<p>...as Python developers we suffer through it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> # python
>>> s = "Hello, World!"
>>> len(s)
13
>>> s.__len__()  # This is what len() calls to get the length
13
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure Python luminaries like Guido Van Rossum, Alex Gaynor, David
Beazley, and Raymond Hettiger can explain why Python works this way.
Their opinions are probably full of logic, history, and grand reasoning.</p>
<p>None of that applies to this blog post.</p>
<h1>Fixing the String Class</h1>
<p>Clearly, it's time for Python to catch up with the other hip dynamic
languages. Therefore, after years of careful study, I give you a Fixed
String class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class String(str):
    """ Adding critically unimportant functionality to Python's str type """

    def len(self):
        return self.__len__()
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see it improves on Python's <code>str</code> type by adding a built-in
<code>len()</code> method. Total success!</p>
<h1>Improving the String Class</h1>
<p>Now that I've fixed things in Python by creating the <code>String</code> class,
it's time to improve it. Ruby and Javascript both have a length
property/attribute/method/thingee that even my <code>String</code> class lacks.
Ruby's String object even beats up Javascript's String Prototype by
including a handy <code>size</code> method that serves as an alias for it's own
<code>length</code> method.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I come armed with the knowledge of how to use Python's
<code>property</code> decorator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class String(str):
    """ Adding critically unimportant functionality to Python's str type """

    def len(self):
        return self.__len__()

    @property
    def length(self):
        return self.len()

    @property
    def size(self):
        return self.length
</code></pre>
<p>Bam! Python is now equal to Ruby!</p>
<h1>Winning with the String Class</h1>
<p>It's time for Python to take the lead. We've suffered for too long as
second class citizens in terms of string length discovery. Let's add
some more utility methods to our String class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class String(str):
    """ Adding critically unimportant functionality to Python's str type """

    def len(self):
        return self.__len__()

    @property
    def length(self):
        return self.len()

    @property
    def size(self):
        return self.length

    @property
    def width(self):
        return self.length

    @property
    def height(self):
        return self.length

    @property
    def area(self):
        return self.height * self.width
</code></pre>
<p>Boom! Python now dominates with invaluable properties that provide
developers with the width, height, and area of a string. And to think
I'm just getting started...</p>
<h1>Conquering with the String Class</h1>
<p>So far I've carefully changed the Python ecosystem with my brilliant
addition to the language. What if I want to get stupidly dangerous? What
if I want to allow developers the <strong>dangerous capability to alter the
returned length of a String</strong>? Fortunately for me, and unfortunately for
anyone who uses this code on a real project, I know how to be this
stupidly dangerous.</p>
<p>I present to you the <code>ConqueringString</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import math

class ConqueringString(String):
    """ Adding stupidly dangerous functionality to Python's str type """

    def __init__(self, text):
        super(ConqueringString, self).__init__(text)
        self._length = self.__len__()

    def __len__(self):
        try:
            return self._length
        except AttributeError:
            return super(ConqueringString, self).__len__()

    def len(self, value=None):
        if value is None:
            return self._length
        self._length = value

    @property
    def length(self):
        return self.len()

    @length.setter
    def length(self, value):
        self._length = value

    @property
    def size(self):
        return self.length

    @size.setter
    def size(self, value):
        self.length = value

    @property
    def area(self):
        return self.height * self.width

    @area.setter
    def area(self, value):
        self.length = math.sqrt(value)
</code></pre>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = ConqueringString("Hello, World!")
    print(s)
    print(s.length)
    s.length = 5
    print(s.length)
    print(s.area)
    s.area = 50
    print(s.area)
    print(len(s))
    print(s[5:10]) # slicing still works!
    print(s.upper()) # other methods still work!
</code></pre>
<p>Run it and see. Or grab it off PyPI with <code>pip install stringtheory</code>.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Don't forget <code>pip install stringtheory</code>!</p>
<p>We can implement this power using Python lists, tuples, dictionaries,
and everything else we can imagine. Let's do it!</p>

<p>This was my 2013 <a href="/fixing-pythons-string-class.html#april-fool-s-joke">April Fool's

<p>However, the code was a lot of fun to write and after Mike Bayer's
comment about <code>__new__</code> and a number of serious questions that people
emailed me yesterday, I plan to follow this post with some more
discussion on how to expand on native types in Python.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/core-concepts-django-forms</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/core-concepts-django-forms"/>
        <updated>2013-03-29T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my opinion, the concepts behind Django's non-model forms can be
listed in just three (3) bullets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms render HTML.</li>
<li>Forms are "just" Python constructs.</li>
<li>Forms validate dictionaries (Python's Key/Value structure).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's dig in!</p>
<h1>Forms render HTML.</h1>
<p>If I construct a Django form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

class MyForm(forms.Form):

    title = forms.CharField(required=True)
</code></pre>
<p>I can render it in a template, or for better clarity in this post, the
Python REPL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from myapp.forms import MyForm
>>> f = MyForm()
>>> f
&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1016c6990>
>>> print(f)
&#x3C;tr>&#x3C;th>&#x3C;label for="id_title">Title:&#x3C;/label>&#x3C;/th>
&#x3C;td>&#x3C;input id="id_title" name="title" type="text" />&#x3C;/td>&#x3C;/tr>
</code></pre>
<p>You can even see this done with initial values in the Django docs:
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.Form.initial">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.Form.initial</a></p>
<h1>Forms are "just" Python constructs.</h1>
<p>I believe it was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_gaynor">Alex</a>
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/">Gaynor</a> who said back in 2008 that Django forms
were "just" Python constructs. He's right:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from myapp.forms import MyForm
>>> # class
>>> MyForm
&#x3C;class 'myapp.forms.MyForm'>
>>> # object
>>> form = MyForm()
>>> form
&#x3C;myapp.forms.MyForm object at 0x1023f1450>
>>> # iterable
>>> [x for x in form]
[&#x3C;django.forms.forms.BoundField object at 0x102495990>]
>>> [x for x in form.fields]
['title']
>>> # dictionary-like
>>> form.fields['title']
&#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x1024a17d0>
</code></pre>
<p>Understanding the structure of Django forms is really useful. This
structure is what allows the modification mechanism that I described in
my <a href="/overloading-form-fields.html">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>We don't have to stop in just the <code>forms.py</code> module. You can also
modify forms in views (either the classic <code>views.py</code> module or in
whatever API library you might be using):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django import forms
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.views.generic import FormView

class MyFormView(FormView):

    form_class = MyForm

    def get_form(self, form_class):
        form = form_class(**self.get_form_kwargs())
        form.fields['favorite_icecream'] = forms.ChoiceField(
            label="What is your favorite flavor from this list?",
            choices=((0, "Chocolate"), (1, "Vanilla"), (2, "Berry")),
            widget=forms.RadioSelect,
            required=True
        )
        return form

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Get user's favorite ice cream.
        # You can do anything you want with it
        favorite_icecream = form.cleaned_data['favorite_icecream']

        # return the anticipated redirect
        return redirect("home")
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, with an understanding of basic Python types and some
experience with Django forms you can become very creative in
applications of forms. Please keep in mind that the devil is in the
details, and overly creative use of forms (or anything) is a road you
should carefully tread. It's always good to remember that simplicity is
best and that the goal isn't to just write code, but to write
maintainable code.</p>
<h1>Forms validate dictionaries.</h1>
<p>One of the primary functions of any HTTP-friendly form libraries is
validating dictionary-like data objects. HTTP query strings are
key/value structures and in order to avoid corruption in the persistence
layer of any project, regardless of framework or language, validation
needs to occur.</p>
<p>During it's request/response cycle Django converts <code>HTTP POST</code> (and
<code>HTTP GET</code>) objects into something called a <code>QueryDict</code>, which is an
merely an extended Django dictionary. See the comments in the code
example below for proof:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import logging

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.http.request import QueryDict
from django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDict

logger = logging.getLogger(__main__)

def my_form_view(request):

    logging.debug(
        # logs True because request.POST is an instance of QueryDict
        isinstance(request.POST, QueryDict)
    )
    logging.debug(
        # logs True because QueryDict is a dictionary
        issubclass(QueryDict, dict)
    )      

    return HttpResponse()
</code></pre>
<p>This is all fine and good, but what does it mean for developers trying
to solve problems? Well, it means that Django forms serve quite handily
as a means for validation of dictionaries:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from myapp.forms import MyForm
>>> good_form = MyForm({"title": "Two Scoops of Django"})
>>> good_form.is_valid()
True
>>> good_form.errors
{}
>>> bad_form = MyForm({})
>>> bad_form.is_valid()
False
>>> bad_form.errors
{'title': [u'This field is required.']}
</code></pre>
<p>The power of this can't be understated. In fact, I'll be exploring
this particular facet of Django forms more in at least one upcoming blog
post.</p>
<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<p>ModelForms adds at least three more bullets...</p>
<ul>
<li>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML</li>
<li>ModelForms automatically choose validators based off of Model field
definitions.</li>
<li>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>... and I touch on them in <a href="/core-concepts-django-modelforms.html">my post on
ModelForms</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the patterns we get positive feedback for mentioning in our
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/">book</a> is <strong>overloading form fields</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem this pattern handles is the use case of when we have a model
with a field(s) that allows for blank values, how do we force users to
enter values?</p>
<p>For example, assuming the following model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):

    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    age = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    profession = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)
</code></pre>
<p>How do we make all those fields (name, age, profession, bio) required
without modifying the database?</p>
<p>This is the way I used to do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=True)
    age = forms.IntegerField(required=True)
    profession = forms.CharField(required=True)
    bio = forms.TextField(required=True)

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<p>See the problems with this approach?</p>
<p><code>MyModelForm</code> is nearly a copy of <code>MyModel</code>, and was in fact created by
copy/pasting model and then modifying it. In software engineering
parlance, it violates the principal of Don't Repeat Yourself
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>) and is
fertile ground for introducing bugs.</p>
<h1><code>MyModelForm</code> has a bug!</h1>
<p>Can you spot the bug?</p>
<p>The code example below illuminates where I purposefully/gleefully placed
an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyModel(models.Model):

    # 50 character database field
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    # Most people don't write tests to check for field length.
    # 100 character form field - probably not spotted until deployed.
    # Easy error to make when violating DRY since the model can change
    #   and leave the form definition behind.
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Bugs like this happen either because developers are human and make
mistakes, or because the model evolves over time and the forms are left
behind. This is a serious maintenance issue, and one that will bite you
or the developers who end up maintaining code you've written.</p>
<p>Can you spot the second bug? ;-)</p>
<p>How do we fix this?</p>
<h1>A Better Way</h1>
<p>In instantiated Django forms, fields are kept in a dict-like object.
Which means, instead of writing forms in a way that duplicates the
model, a better way is to explicitly modify only what we want to modify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Making name required
        self.fields['name'].required = True
        self.fields['age'].required = True
        self.fields['bio'].required = True
        self.fields['profession'].required = True

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<h2>Other field attributes</h2>
<p>This isn't just limited to the <code>required</code> attribute. It can also be
applied to <code>help_text</code>, <code>label</code>, <code>choices</code>, <code>widgets</code>, or any other form
field attribute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django import forms

from .models import MyModel

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # snip the other fields for the sake of brevity
        # Adding content to the form
        self.fields['profession'].help_text = "Job title here"

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it with Inheritance!</h2>
<p>We can even do this with inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django import forms

class BaseEmailForm(forms.Form):
    email = forms.EmailField("Email")
    email2 = forms.EmailField("Email 2")

    def clean(self, *args, **kwargs):
        email = self.cleaned_data['email']
        email2 = self.cleaned_data['email2']
        if email != email2:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Emails don't match")
        return self.cleaned_data

class ContactForm(BaseEmailForm):
    message = forms.CharField()

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ContactForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs):
        self.fields['email2'].label = "Confirm your email"
        self.fields['email2'].help_text = "We want to be sure!"
</code></pre>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>From the perspective of general software development, it's always a
good thing to avoid repeating yourself. This might seem like as much or
in some cases even more typing, but it's a lot better than making an
embarrassing/costly mistake.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a Python developer our approach more closely
matches the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>.
This is because we only modify the field properties that need to be
modified, the approach specified is more explicit.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/meme</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/meme"/>
        <updated>2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by <a href="https://blog.aclark.net/2013/12/30/new-years-python-meme-2014/">Alex Clark's
meme</a>,
here is my own entry into this end-of-year fun.</p>
<h1>What's the Coolest Thing You Discovered This Year?</h1>
<p>Alex had his own focused on Python applications, frameworks, and
libraries. Me, I'm going for a more general approach. This year I
discovered:</p>
<h2>LaTeX</h2>
<p>That <a href="dhttps://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> I co-wrote with <a href="https://audreyr.com">Audrey
Roy</a>? Written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. It wasn't easy to get
started, even with Audrey as my instructor, but now that I grok it, I
feel extremely empowered. That's because I can do all kinds of awesome,
insane hacks when <a href="https://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> generates PDFs. I
hope I get the chance to show off some of my new madness to the world in
2014.</p>
<h2>How to Tie A Bow Tie</h2>
<p>If you are going to be formal, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie">bow
tie</a> adds an enormous amount of
class. However, clip-ons are considered tacky, especially as it's
considered stylish to loosen the bow tie later in the evening to
demonstrate you aren't wearing that clip.</p>
<p>Of all the stuff I watched on the subject of bow tying, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PTLV-L_sk">this
video</a> was the longest and
the best of them all.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1/4/2014:</strong> I learned this awesome skill because <a href="/i-married-audrey-roy.html">I wanted to
be classy on my wedding
day</a>.</p>
<h2>Awesome Foods Around the World</h2>
<p>Here's the short-list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek">Oscypek</a> is a Polish smoked,
salted cheese that should be exported to the universe. Seriously. If
you get some, grill it and serve with jelly.</li>
<li>In Florence, Italy you can eat Duck Carpaccio and it is heavenly. If
there is ever a reason to visit Florence, it is Duck Carpaccio.</li>
<li>The Croatian King Truffle Bar is an ice cream delicacy you can find
in any street market freezer. It's multiple shells of chocolate and
ice cream in an ice cream bar that speaks taste bud breaking volumes
to at least the American palate.</li>
<li>In the Philippines, they combine shaved ice, evaporated milk, purple
yam ice cream, and tropical fruits into something they call
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo">Halo-Halo</a>. It's
indescribably yummy and the Los Angeles-based Jollibee version
Anthony Bourdain tried on his show is a pale comparison to the
fantastic treat I've been lucky enough to devour in Manila.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What New Programming Technique Did You Learn This Year?</h1>
<p>Hard to say, but I'll go with Python's context managers. Trying to
find a way to have what I learned see the light of day. Love the
clients, but this is a good reason to try and do more open source work.</p>
<h1>Which Open Source Project Did You Contribute to the Most This Year? What Did You Do?</h1>
<p>While I contributed nothing directly to the framework itself, between
our book and numerous open source projects, I guess the answer is
'Django'.</p>
<p>In 2014 I want to switch that focus to Python.</p>
<h1>What Are the Top Three Things You Want to Learn Next Year?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The new async framework added in Python 3.4.</li>
<li>C because I think it will enhance my Python skills.</li>
<li>How to be a better person. I think I educated and helped a lot of
people this year, but I can do better. <strong>Malcolm Tredennick</strong>
quietly led the way, and with all the help he provided to Audrey and
I in January for our book, we owe it to his memory to improve the
lot of developers everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is the Top Thing You Wish Someone Would Write Next Year?</h1>
<p>Something that gets more women into the top 10 of
<a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>. That amazing women developers and
community leaders in the Python community like <a href="https://www.gittip.com/roguelynn/">Lynn
Root</a>, <a href="https://www.gittip.com/jessicamckellar/">Jessica
McKellar</a>, dare I say
<a href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/">Audrey</a>
<a href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/">Roy</a>, and others aren't up there
speaks uncomfortable volumes. Starting today, I'm directing all my
Gittip funds in their direction. Well... not Audrey because she won't
let me, but you get the idea.</p>
<h1>What Else?</h1>
<p>This year, 2013, was a wonderful year. Everything changed. I hope to
have a summary out today because some fantastically incredible things
occurred. If not, then it will happen next year... err... tomorrow!
;-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've joined forces with Matt Harrison and Audrey Roy to put together
the first ever <a href="https://www.pythonindiebundle.com">Python Indie Bundle</a>
sale!</p>
<p>This bundle includes the following e-book bundles (PDF, Kindle, ePub)
for just <strong>$24.95</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treading on Python Volume 1: Foundations</li>
<li>Treading on Python Volume 2: Intermediate</li>
<li>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</li>
</ul>
<p>Bought individually, these three books would cost you $36.95, but in
honor of Cyber Monday we've chopped off about 33%, bringing you the
awesome price of just <strong>$24.95</strong>!</p>
<p>We're just indie authors who work without a publisher. We pay all the
bills, do all the marketing, and make it or break it on our own. It's a
lot of work, but we think the total control we have over our work speaks
volumes for the quality of result.</p>
<p>If you've been to my blog before, you probably already know about Two
Scoops of Django that I co-wrote with Audrey Roy. However, you may not
know about Matt Harrison's books, so I'm going to share some thoughts:</p>
<p>Matt has a talent for explaining things related to Python. If you are
still new to Python, his books will amplify your skills and get you to
the next level. If you've been doing Python for a while, his
intermediate book will illuminate how things like decorators,
generators, and other great features of Python can be leveraged to make
your code cleaner and faster. In a nutshell, Matt's books pay for
themselves because they ramp up your skills.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-yields-are-fun"/>
        <updated>2013-11-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While you can optimize the heck out of your Python code with
<code>generators</code> and <code>generator expressions</code> I'm more interested in goofing
around and solving classic programming questions with the <code>yield</code>
statement.</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> For this article, since it's easier to explain things as they
happen, I'll be including a lot of inline comments.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple function that returns a sequence of some of
my favorite values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># yielding.py
def pydanny_selected_numbers():

    # If you multiple 9 by any other number you can easily play with
    #   numbers to get back to 9.
    #   Ex: 2 * 9 = 18. 1 + 8 = 9
    #   Ex: 15 * 9 = 135. 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    #   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
    yield 9

    # A pretty prime.
    yield 31

    # What's 6 * 7?
    yield 42

    # The string representation of my first date with Audrey Roy
    yield "2010/02/20"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>note:</strong> When a function uses the <code>yield</code> keyword it's now called a
<strong>generator</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's do a test drive in the REPL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from yielding import pydanny_selected_numbers  # import ye aulde code

>>> pydanny_selected_numbers()  # create the iterator object
&#x3C;generator object pydanny_selected_numbers at 0x1038a03c0>

>>> for i in pydanny_selected_numbers():  # iterate through the iterator
...     print(i)
...
9
31
42
"2010/02/20"

>>> iterator = pydanny_selected_numbers() # create the iterator object
>>> for i in iterator:  # iterate through the iterator object
...     print(i)
...
9
31
42
"2010/02/20"
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if you know anything about generator expressions, you know I
could do this more tersely with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> iterator = (x for x in [9, 31, 42, "2010/02/20"]) 
>>> for i in iterator:
...     print(i)
...
9
31
42
"2010/02/20"
</code></pre>
<p>While that is more terse, it doesn't give us the amount of control we
get by defining our own generator function. For example, what if I want
to present the Fibonacci sequence in a loop rather than with recursion?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># fun.py
def fibonacci(max):
    result = 0
    base = 1
    while result &#x3C;= max:

        # This yield statement is where the execution leaves the function.
        yield result
        # This is where the execution comes back into the function. This is
        # just whitespace, but that it came back while preserving the state
        # of the function is pretty awesome.

        # Fibonacci code to increase the number according to
        #   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
        n = result + base
        result = base
        base = n

if __name__ == "__main__":

    for x in fibonacci(144):
        print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try this out in the REPL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from fun import fibonacci
>>> fibonacci(10)
&#x3C;generator object fibonacci at 0x10d49e460>
>>> for x in fibonacci(10):
...     print(x)
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
>>> iterator = fibonacci(5)
>>> iterator
&#x3C;generator object fibonacci at 0x10d63c550>
>>> iterator.next()
0
>>> iterator.next()
1
</code></pre>
<p>What's nice about this is so much more than fibonacci logic in a
generator function. Instead, imagine instead of a lightweight
calculation I had done something performance intensive. By using
generator expressions I can readily control the execution calls with the
iterator object's <code>next()</code> method, saving processor cycles.</p>
<p>Very nifty.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I admit it. Like many Python developers, I find using tools like yields
and generators to optimize the heck out of performance intensive things
a lot of fun.</p>
<p>If you are like me and like this sort of stuff, I recommend the
following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-Volume-Intermediate/dp/149055095X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?tag=mlinar-20">Matt Harrison's Treading on Python Volume 2: Intermediate

Explained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next article I'll demonstrate how to use the <code>yield</code> statement
to create context managers.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ntoll">Nicholas Tollervey</a> pointed me
at wikipedia's Digital root article, so I added it to the comments of
the first code sample.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Oddthinking pointed out that I forgot a print statement. In
the REPL it's not really needed, but if this is translated to a script
then it's necessary.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>note</strong>: This is the first part in a series about a family research
trip to Dynów, Poland in May 2013.</p>
<p>This was our second trip to Poland. Last year (2012) I went with
<a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a> in 2012 for a few days to present at a
software conference called <a href="https://pl.pycon.org/">PyCon Poland</a>. We
stayed for a few days afterwards in the eerily familiar Krakow, always
conscious that my family heritage was perhaps just hours away. You see,
my mother and father's family come from Jews who emigrated to the USA
respectively about 110 and 90 years ago. Unfortunately, for many reasons
boiling down to time, resources, and contacts I held off from exploring
my family roots, promising myself I would return one day.</p>
<p>Now I was back in Poland, with both the time, resources, and contacts to
make it possible to explore at least a portion of my family roots. This
year I would get to research and visit where my grand-father's roots in
south-eastern Poland. We blocked out some time, made various
reservations, talked to family members such as my mother and Aunt
Bernice (who <a href="https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/krosno/Krosnodubtrip.htm">wrote about her trip in
2006</a>), and
leaned heavily on the graces of close friends Tomasz 'Tomek'
Paczkowski and Alexandra 'Ola' Sendecka.</p>
<p>We knew we were in for an uphill battle researching the family. You
can't just go to a computer and search. In fact, as of the summer of
2013 there isn't really a central database of information for Jewish
ancestry - what exists is still under construction and rather
incomplete. That means you have to go and look at old documents
yourself, which are incomplete and hard to find. You see, over the
decades various documents have been destroyed by accident or war,
meaning that the old property/census/tax documents are either incomplete
or broken up into parts seperated by hours of travel.</p>
<p>Getting to Dynów was a matter of renting a car and having Tomasz drive
us from Krakow. Most of it was on a pretty new highway and we zipped
along at a rapid pace. Once we got to Rzeszow and the highway ended, we
were on the winding country roads that make up most of Poland. While
unbelievably scenic, the country roads make Poland feel much larger than
it seems; explaining why we would not be able to accomodate the requests
from various family members and friends in the USA to visit the villages
of their ancestors.</p>
<p>More about the trip is forthcoming later in the series. In the meantime,
here are some things still being edited:</p>

        <updated>2013-08-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's a given that in order to travel you need to have money or make a
lot of money, right?</p>
<p>That's not really true.</p>
<p>There are ways to live well but cheaply. It takes a bit of discipline,
forethought, and judgement, but the reward of living is amazing. This
article explains how <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a> and I do it.</p>
<h1>Pick the Right Location</h1>
<p>A number of famous destination cities are expensive no matter what you
do. San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo
might be wonderful, but they are also places where you have to pay more.
More for everything. Rent, food, and accessory costs are likely to be at
least double what you expect.</p>
<p>Similarly, certain entire countries are expensive. Switzerland,
Slovenia, Australia, and New Zealand are lovely, but everything just
costs more there.</p>
<p>Also, if the transit system is good, consider staying a little further
from the expensive downtown or waterfront. This can make even expensive
cities affordable.</p>
<p>Affordable places we've discovered this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barcelona, Spain</li>
<li>Bologna, Italy</li>
<li>Florence, Italy</li>
<li>Krakow, Poland</li>
<li>Islands near Split, Croatia</li>
<li>Warsaw, Poland</li>
<li>Zagreb, Croatia</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our resource is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Cheapest-Destinations-Countries-ebook/dp/B00AYIBO1M/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;sr=&#x26;tag=mlinar-20">The World's Cheapest
Destinations</a>,
which, if nothing else, is an interesting read.</p>
<h1>Use a service to find a place and stay a while</h1>
<p>Use a service like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com">airbnb</a> or the local
equivalent to find a place. Some people like to just stay at hostels, we
prefer apartments. Stay for a month so you get a lower rate.</p>
<p>Try to research the nearby grocery shopping. While little stores are
wonderful, they cost more than a large supermarket. The supermarket will
allow you to stay cheaply in an area. However, make sure to check out
the little markets at least once a week because the food there is often
much, much better.</p>
<p>Our two constant requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi (we work remotely)</li>
<li>Washing machine</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you work remotely</h2>
<p>We're fortunate in that our work lets us work remotely. Keep in mind
the two cardinal rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be available in real-time:</strong> Use Google Hangouts, Chat, IRC or
whatever at regular times to demonstrate you are working.</li>
<li><strong>Get your work done on time:</strong> If you are working remotely while
traveling, you have to demonstrate to the client/boss that the
travel isn't a distraction. If you seem flakey, they'll seriously
consider other options besides you. Honestly, who can blame them?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Try to Cook and Eat at Home</h1>
<p>Our rule is we eat out once a week. Otherwise, it's all home cooking.
Even when we do tourist things on our day off, we bring food from home.</p>
<p>Also, the ingredients are always different. Fruits, vegetables, and
meats are grown in different soils and climates and taste different.
This means don't try and replicate what you eat at home, cook simple
things they make where you are.</p>
<h1>Finding Good, Affordable Restaurants</h1>
<p>Finding good, affordable restaurants is easy. Here are our steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find a place that looks busy.</strong> A busy place means the food is
palatable and because of volume, the food is fresh. If the place is
empty, walk away.</li>
<li><strong>Check the menu for prices.</strong> If they make you flinch, walk away.</li>
<li><strong>Listen to what people are saying.</strong> If it's in your version of
your language, walk away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you stay, keep in mind local portion sizes. For example, in slavic
countries like Poland and Croatia, the portions can be quite large. What
we sometimes do is share a main course and use the savings to buy drinks
or dessert.</p>
<p>If you like beer, try to order local varieties of beer. They often sell
for less and can be really tasty.</p>
<p>If you like wine, the rule goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the USA, order the cheapest non-house wine.</li>
<li>In Europe, order the house wine.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What Else?</h1>
<p>I'll be updating this article in the days and months and hopefully
years to come.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/easy-form-views-controversy</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/easy-form-views-controversy"/>
        <updated>2013-05-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2010 <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles">Frank Wiles</a> of
<a href="https://revsys.com">Revsys</a> exposed me to what I later called the
"<strong>Easy Form Views</strong>" pattern when creating Django form function
views. I used this technique in a variety of places, including <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com">Django
Packages</a> and the documentation for
django-uni-form (which is rebooted as
<a href="https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms</a>).
At DjangoCon 2011 <a href="https://tothinkornottothink.com/">Miguel Araujo</a> and I
opened our <a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/shbrd/">Advanced Django Forms
Usage</a> talk at DjangoCon
2011 with this technique. It's a pattern that reduces the complexity of
using forms in Django function-based views by flattening the form
handling code.</p>
<h1>How the Easy Form Views pattern works</h1>
<p>Normally, function-based views in Django that handle form processing
look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_view(request, template_name="my_app/my_form.html"):

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = MyForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            do_x() # custom logic here
            return redirect('home')
    else:
        form = MyForm()
    return render(request, template_name, {'form': form})
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, the Easy Form Views pattern works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_view(request, template_name="my_app/my_form.html"):

    form = MyForm(request.POST or None)
    if form.is_valid():
        do_x() # custom logic here
        return redirect('home')
    return render(request, template_name, {'form': form})
</code></pre>
<p>The way this works is that the <code>django.http.HttpRequest</code> object has a
POST attribute that defaults to an empty dictionary-like object, even if
the request's method is equal to "GET". Since we know that
request.POST exists in every Django view, and os at least as an empty
dictionary-like object, we can skip the <code>request.method == 'POST'</code> by
doing a simple boolean check on the <code>request.POST</code> dictionary.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>request.POST</code> dictionary evaluates as <code>True</code>, then instantiate
the form bound with <code>request.POST</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>the request.POST</code> dictionary evaluates as <code>False</code>, then
instantiate an unbound form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great! Faster to write and shallower code! What could possibly be wrong
with that?</p>
<h1>The Controversy</h1>
<p>Before you jump to convert all your function based forms to this
pattern, consider the following argument raised against it by a good
friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one of those things where "empty dictionary and null both
evaluate as false" can bite you.</p>
<p>There's a difference between "There is no POST data", and "This
wasn't a POST".</p>
<p>-- by <a href="https://cecinestpasun.com/">Russell Keith-Magee</a> (paraphrased)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem he is talking about is data besides <code>multipart/form-data</code> or
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> would still end up in the
<code>request.POST</code> dictionary-like attribute.</p>
<p>Where is the controversy? Well, I didn't write a retraction until now.
Arguably I should have done it earlier. However, since I never ran into
the edge case, I didn't see the need. Yet when it comes down to it, the
"Easy Forms" approach has an implicit assumption about the incoming
object, which in Python terms is not a good thing.</p>
<h1>Getting bit by the Easy Form Views method</h1>
<p>Here's how it happens:</p>
<p><strong>Before Django 1.5</strong> HTTP methods such as DELETE or PUT would see their
data placed into Django's <code>request.POST</code> attribute. The form would
fail, but it might not be clear to the developer or user why. HTTP GET
and POST methods work as expected.</p>
<p><strong>For Django 1.5 (and later)</strong> if a non-POST comes in then the form
fails because request.POST is empty. HTTP GET and POST methods also work
as expected.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Going forward, I prefer to use Django's class-based views or <a href="https://djangorestframework.com">Django
Rest Framework</a> which make the issue of
this pattern moot. When I do dip into function-based views handling
classic HTML forms, I'm leery of using this pattern anymore. Yes, it is
an edge case, but to inaccurately paraphrase Russell, "edge cases are
where you get bit".</p>
<p>What I'm not going to do is rush to change existing views on existing
projects. That's because personally I've yet to run into an actual
problem with using this pattern. As they say, "<em>If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.</em>" While I'm not saying my code isn't broken, I'm also
aware that 'fixing' things that aren't reporting errors is a
dangerous path to tread.</p>
<p>Also, next time I get called on something by a person I respect, I'll
respond more quickly. Nearly two years is too long a wait.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Changed some of the text to be more succinct and took out
the leading sentence.</p>

leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the evaluation, use,
and extension of third party Python and Django applications in your
projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a lot of detailed and
annotated code examples.</p>
<p>::: {#PyCon}
This tutorial does much more than instruct on how to wire in third party
packages, it also instructs on Django/Python best practices such as
PEP-8, loose coupling, good database design, clarity of concept, and
workable patterns.
:::</p>
<p>Material covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating packages using Django Packages, PyPI, Read the Docs, and
other sources.</li>
<li>Must-include packages for every project</li>
<li>Class-based Views</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Admin</li>
</ul>
<h1>Format</h1>
<p>This will be a lecture with detailed and annotated code examples.
Attendees will have a chance per section to ask questions and submit
alternative packages of their own.</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Practical or professional experience with Django is recommended, but the
material covered will be useful to anyone familiar with Python who has
completed the Django tutorial.</p>
<p>If you are a new Python developer, we suggest in addition to our course

<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/92/">Location, Location,
Location</a>
(Julia Grace) - Django, via the GeoDjango toolkit has amazing
support for building GIS based applications. Julia's an experienced
developer and great speaker, making this a can't miss talk!</li>
</ul>
<h2>3:15 PM talks</h2>
<p>There isn't a beginner-focused talk in this slot, so I'm going to make
this the <em>roller-coaster</em> slot. In other words, I'm going to steer you
to the most intensely advanced talk at this time. Attend, buckle in the
safety harness, and drink in the extreme knowledge!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/80/">Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web
applications</a>
(Graham Dumpleton) - It is not hard to find developers who will tell
you that Apache sucks for running Python web applications. Is there
a valid basis to such claims or have they simply been misguided by
the views of others? Well, Graham understands how Python serves up
web pages and won't hold back on technical detail.</li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/130/">Numba: A Dynamic Python compiler for
Science</a>
(Travis Oliphant, Siu Kwan Lam, Mark Florisson) - Numba is a
compiler for Python syntax that uses the LLVM library and llvmpy to
convert specifically decorated Python functions to machine code at
run-time. It allows Python syntax to be used to do scientific and
numerical computing that is blazing fast yet tightly integrated with
the CPython run-time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4:15 talk</h2>
<p>For this time period there is a single talk specifically aimed at
beginners. There are some other useful talks around this time, but they
are aimed at educators and integrators over beginners.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/74/">Crypto 101</a>
(Laurens Van Houtven) - Cryptography is a tricky subject, and the
goal of this 4:15 PM talk isn't to turn attendees into cryptography
experts. Instead, you'll have a basic understanding of how some
common systems compare, and also a sense for detecting and exposing
snake oil.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4:30 PM talk</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/102/">Getting Python and Django Through Your Java Shop Front Door (with
Jython)</a>
(Frank Wierzbicki) - Work in a Java shop and want to bring in
Python? Learn how to do it using Jython, the Python implementation
that works in the JVM!</li>
</ul>
<h2>5:10 PM talks</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/138/">MTO On Blast: Using Python's Natural Language Toolkit to Model
Gossip Blogs</a>
(Robert Elwell) - Python's powerful Natural Language Toolkit will
be featured as the presenter gives an overview of Natural Language
Processing.</li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/103/">What is the Python Software
Foundation?</a>
(Brian Curtin) - This talk aims to engage us in thinking about what
it takes to further Python. Whether it's an idea of code,
community, or otherwise, it will jumpstart us into helping the very
positive community that has brought us together for the amazing
event that is PyCon.</li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/128/">Asset Management in
Python</a>
(Robert Kluin, Beau Lyddon) - Coffeescript, Less, SASS, and all
those other exciting new front end asset tools can be a challenge to
deploy when doing web development in tools like Django, Flask, and
Pyramid. The presenters will introduce <em>webassets</em>, a library
designed to make deployment of assets quick and easy.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Evening Activities</h1>
<p>Saturday night will be the evening of a huge number of fantastic fun.
Two items of note (more to come):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/sponsors/charityauction/">The PyCon Charity
Auction</a> (6:30
PM+) - Along with Disney Animation Studios and many others, Audrey
and I are contributing! In fact, we're submitting a one of a kind,
preview copy of the upcoming print edition of <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two Scoops of Django:
Best Practices for Django 1.5</a>!</li>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/we-are-not-using-paypal</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/we-are-not-using-paypal"/>
        <updated>2013-03-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a> and I launched a
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> about Django called <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two Scoops of
Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a>. We
decided to not use PayPal. Here's why:</p>
<h1>Open Source Events Get Burned By PayPal</h1>
<p>PayPal has a long, sordid history of freezing the accounts of Python
related conferences and events around the world. In fact, this article
was born out of the fact <a href="https://blog.djangocircus.com/post/43806402173/back-on-track">DjangoCon Europe 2013 had its PayPal account
frozen</a>. In
the past, <a href="https://2012.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2012</a>, Plone
Conferences 2008, 2011, and at least one PyCon Australia dealt with the
same PayPal problem (DjangoCon 2013 was forewarned and took measures to
protect itself). We also have unconfirmed reports of other Python and
Django events also running into problems with PayPal freezing accounts.
Going with just confirmed conferences having issues with PayPal, this is
a combined total of assets in excess of over US$100,000 dollars.</p>
<p>It's not just a Python issue either, it's an issue that <a href="https://conferencesburnedbypaypal.tumblr.com/">strikes other
open source languages and
tools</a>. It's at the point
now where <a href="https://aralbalkan.com/3898/">conference organizers don't trust
PayPal</a> and make a point telling each other
to use alternative payment gateways.</p>
<h1>Fear, Shame, and PayPal</h1>
<p>The terrifying thing to consider is that I suspect that the number of
technical conferences affected by PayPal freezes is much, much larger.
My reasoning is that <strong>most conferences keep quiet about it</strong> because
<strong>they're afraid that raising a fuss will annoy PayPal's anti-fraud
division</strong>. Let's also face the fact that <strong>most people feel ashamed
when bank accounts they are responsible for get frozen</strong>, so probably
don't publicize the issue.</p>
<p>The usual way conferences deal with these lockouts is conference
organizers beg and borrow from friends, family, take second mortgages,
local banking institutions, and pray that PayPal will eventually free
their account. When you deal with a hostile, inaccessible payment
gateway who won't let you provide for the hundreds or even thousands of
people who paid you their hard earned money, it's the only way to get
by.</p>
<h1>The 'Needs' of PayPal's Anti-Fraud Division</h1>
<p>While I could respect the needs of PayPal's anti-fraud division when
dealing with non-fungible products like ticket sales, it's <strong>simply
unacceptable</strong> that prominent conferences for open source projects are
treated this way.</p>
<p>The software represented by these conferences drives the modern
e-commerce world, including the myriad of systems that use PayPal to
process sales. Yet PayPal continues to burn open source conferences year
after year, and we've never heard of any conference outreach by their
so-called 'developer evangelists' when a conference's account is
frozen.</p>
<h1>Legal recourse against PayPal is folly</h1>
<p>Ask any lawyer and they'll basically say against PayPal you have no
options. PayPal has an army of lawyers and in most places isn't a bank,
meaning your course of action is constrained from the beginning by your
agreeing to PayPal's Terms of Service (TOS). Also, in the United
States, their TOS prevents you from joining a class action lawsuit
against them. Whether or not that TOS clause is enforceable in court,
the fact that it is in their TOS greatly reduces any faith I might have
had in them because it paints a picture of a company hostile to my
needs.</p>
<p>In talking to authors and entrepreneurs, we've just heard (and read)
too many horror stories. For merchants of non-fungible goods such as
digital goods like the e-book I co-authored, PayPal seems even less
trustworthy.</p>
<p>Which means using PayPal places us at an unacceptable risk. We simply
don't have the deep pockets to deal with PayPal freezing our funds for
sales lost from a more reliable distribution system such as
<a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> that powers our sales through
<a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>.</p>
<h1>It is Wrong to Use PayPal</h1>
<p>Considering PayPal's unacceptable behavior in regards to the open
source community I love and merchants who try to work in their system, I
feel it is wrong to support PayPal. Audrey agrees, and so our policy of
not using PayPal to sell the book is set.</p>
<h1>PayPal is at Risk</h1>
<p>There was a day when Microsoft had what seemed to be an unassailable
lock on the commercial software world. On many levels, Microsoft is a
shadow of its former self, and I contend it wasn't just Apple's
competition. Instead, Microsoft's contempt for their own customers and
the developer community hurt them just as much.</p>
<p>PayPal is on the same path of self-destruction. The've gone from the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/0977898431/?tag=ihpydanny-20">scrappy
company</a>
helping people grow their business to the monolithic overlord that kills
businesses and well-meaning events.</p>
<p>PayPal's demise won't happen this year, or the next, but every time
they damage their customer base and the developer community it's
another nail in the coffin. I submit that unless PayPal changes its
ways, within 5 years PayPal will be a shadow of its former self as the
army of growing competitors such as <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>,
<a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced Payments</a>,
<a href="https://www.wepay.com/">wepay</a>, and
<a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> expands their availability and
options around the world.</p>
<h1>What PayPal Can Do for Conferences</h1>
<p>PayPal does have to worry about ticket sales for bogus events, since
that separates people from their money, but identifying real conferences
is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>PayPal developer evangelists and community managers need to track
every valid developer event in the world. It's the job of people in
these roles to have the connections and subject matter expertise to
identify real events from fake ones.</li>
<li>PayPal needs to sponsor these events. Why? See point #3.</li>
<li>PayPal's anti-fraud division needs to be informed that any PayPal
sponsored event is off-limits.</li>
</ol>
<h1>What PayPal Can Do for Small Business</h1>
<p>PayPal has its developer evangelists, community managers, and marketing
departments working hard. However, at the end of the day, if you treat
your customers with disrespect and a lack of trust, none of that
matters. Bad press and market forces will see their revenues drop as
customers will migrate to solutions that are more trustworthy and less
antagonistic.</p>
<p>I believe that PayPal needs to revise how its anti-fraud division
communicates with people who have frozen accounts. They need to change
the adversarial pose they take with their own customers to one that is
collaborative.</p>
<h1>Note</h1>
<p>If this makes you angry as it did me, take a deep breath and step back.

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/two-scoops-beta-released</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/two-scoops-beta-released"/>
        <updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After thirty four days of hard work, <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a>
and I are proud to announce that we've released the <strong>beta</strong> of <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two
Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.5</a>. It's been a monumental effort, a labor
of love, and we hope you find our efforts worthy. You can buy it right
now in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5</a></p>
<p>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is a compilation of
best practices for the Django framework. Like any framework, Django has
tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place.
Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet
takes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it
down.</p>
<p>We stand of the shoulders of giants: We received advice from Django
experts including a BDFL, Django core developers, and subject matter
experts from around the world. Reader contributions from advanced and
beginning developers have also shaped the book, and we can't thank
enough those who gave us their insights.</p>
<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/"><img src="/images/tsd15-beta.png" alt="Beta launch image for TSD 1.5"></a></p>
<h1><a name="features"></a>
What is different about the beta release?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Added 50+ pages of content while reducing the file size from 5.1 MB
to 1.5 MB.</li>
<li>Added list of tables, list of figures, and an index.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the chapters on security, testing, logging,
admin, and many more.</li>
<li>Added so many more code samples that even with the new example
numbering system we lost count.</li>
<li>Speaking of code examples, most of the code samples in the book are
loaded directly out of fully tested projects.</li>
<li>Incorporated the feedback of dozens of readers. Thank you so much
for your contributions!</li>
</ul>
<h1>What does buying the beta get me?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Access the PDF version of the book.</li>
<li>Access to the Kindle and ePub formats when we release the final.</li>
<li>Access to final release of the book.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why aren't there Kindle or ePub versions yet?</h1>
<p>We want to support more formats, but won't do it poorly. It's going to
take us at least several days to render the book in an alternative
format that looks good. Since we both have multiple presentations at the
upcoming <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a>, we simply don't have
time to get it done.</p>
<h1>If I bought the alpha do I have to buy the beta?</h1>
<p>Alpha buyers get full access the beta. In fact, you should have already
received an email with a link to the latest version. If that hasn't
arrived, please email us at <a href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a>.</p>
<h1>Is this book good for beginners?</h1>
<p>The response from beginning Django developers reading it has been
<strong>unbelievably, overwhelmingly positive</strong>. This is the book we wanted to
have when we learned Django, and we're honored by the response the book
has received.</p>
<p>Since the book isn't a tutorial, we ask that before beginners purchase
it, they <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">learn the fundamentals of</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">Python</a>
and take the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/">official Django
tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>When beginners find sections of the book above their head, they do what
everyone does when reading a technical reference: skip over challenging
sections until they have enough grounding to understand.</p>
<p>If any beginners are confused by our explanations, or have difficulties,
please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. We'll do our best to
answer your questions. Your issues provide invaluable insight into what
we need to improve.</p>
<h1>Is this book good for experienced developers?</h1>
<p>We've done our best to provide worthwhile material for developers of
all levels. In fact, a lot of intermediate to advanced developers have
said they've found good things to use in our book. Many have also found
that by using our book as a supplementary manual, it helps them their
team work better.</p>
<h1>Is this book going to get updated?</h1>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>During the <strong>alpha</strong> we updated the book multiple times before knuckling
down on the <strong>beta</strong> rewrite. Even after the final version comes out,
we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of
self-published e-books is we have total control of content.</p>
<h1>When can I get a print version?</h1>
<p>After a lot of consideration, we've decided to hold off on the print
version of the book until what we call the
<a href="/two-scoops-beta-released.html#final">final</a>
release, which won't be released until after <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon
US</a>. We're very finicky and don't want
buyers of the print version to have an unfinished book.</p>
<h1>Tutorial? PyCon? Are you going?</h1>
<p>Yes! We're going to be at PyCon next month! We're giving the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/">Wiring
Up Django Packages</a>
tutorial, and <a href="https://brack3t.com/">Kenneth Love</a> (of <a href="https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/">Getting Started
with Django</a> fame) is part of our
team.</p>
<p>While tickets to PyCon itself are sold out, you can still <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/">register for
the tutorials</a>.</p>
<h1>When is the book's final release?</h1>
<p>The final release won't occur until after PyCon.</p>
<p>Our plan for the final release of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices
for Django 1.5 is to focus on errata, alternative electronic formats,
and the print version.</p>
<h1>Can we purchase the book in bulk?</h1>
<p>We're working on a program to provide organizations the capability to
purchase many e-copies and keep the recipients of the book updated
constantly. We hope to have this ready in a few days.</p>
<h1>Can I buy the book via PayPal?</h1>
<p>No. I've answered in full
<a href="/we-are-not-using-paypal.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We're considering other non-credit card options to handle payment.</p>
<h1>Known Issue Warnings</h1>
<h2>Copy/Paste</h2>
<p>There are problems with copy/pasting of code from the PDF. The new build
process is turning the code examples into some sort of image type of
object, which explains the strange characters. We're working on it, but
aren't sure how long the fix will take.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>On Android, if you try to open the PDF directly from the Gumroad
download, you might get a "Cannot open file" error; however, if you
navigate to the download location on your phone/tablet with a file
browser (e.g. Samsung's "My Files"), you should be able to open the
file from there. Gumroad is currently investigating the issue.</p>
<h1>Where should I send errata or suggestions?</h1>
<p>Please send errata to <a href="mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. We try to respond
personally to every request.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-2"/>
        <updated>2013-01-23T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is Part II in a series of blog posts about <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US
2013</a>. The goal is to provide a handy
reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> conference. <a href="/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html">Part
I</a> was
mostly about <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/">tutorials</a>,
this post will be about registration and the first day of talks.</p>
<h1>Registration</h1>
<p>If you haven't done so yet, please
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/">register</a> now. Last
year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which
is a shame, because the conference is awesome!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a
very good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are
subtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software
Foundation (<a href="https://python.org/psf/">PSF</a>). In addition to supporting
the Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants
for aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you
spend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives. This
isn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a difference for
you, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more, but that's
an article for another day...</p>
<p>Alright, on to the talks!</p>
<h1>Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>
<p>At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and
brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some
quick guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions at the
end, <a href="https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/">go and
ask</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's disconcerting to
give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable
electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using
electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning
them off to look at the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of
hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video.
Heckling is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and
make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the
talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March
15th, has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...</p>
<h2>Friday Morning</h2>
<p>The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM.
From 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches.
PyCon keynotes aren't boring - <strong>they are crazy awesome!</strong>.</p>
<p>In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical
ones.</p>
<h3>10:50 AM talks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/35/">How to Except When You're
Excepting</a>
(Esther Nam) - One of the rising stars of the community, Esther
works for a group that demands 100% test coverage. She's going to
cover the fundamentals of writing tests and why tests are a good
thing.</li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/50/">How the Internet
works</a> (Jessica
McKellar) - Want to know how the internet actually works? Jessica
McKellar (also giving two tutorials and a keynote speech) will use
Python to help you understand what's really going on.</li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/116/">Gittip: Inspiring
Generosity</a>
(Chad Whitacre) - Gittip is an open source Python platform for
sustaining open source development via small, anonymous donations.
This is a technical case-study about the story of community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>11:30 AM talks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/135/">Scrapy: it GETs the
web</a> (Asheesh
Laroia) - In 2009 I took a web scraping tutorial by the author. He
impressed me with his energy and knowledge. While technically this
is an <strong>intermediate</strong> talk, I know everyone will get something out
of this talk</li>
</ul>
<h3>12:10 AM talks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/39/">API Design for Library
Authors</a> (Chris
McDonough) - Well designed APIs are critical for how other
developers interact with your code. Chris is one of the talents in
the community when it comes to creating easy-to-use but extremely
powerful tools. I'm delighted he's made this an introductory talk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday Lunch</h2>
<p>Quick notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't forget to keep your PyCon meal tickets you got when you
registered in the morning or they won't let you into the lunch
room!</li>
<li>Sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every
time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get
to meet <strong>amazing</strong> people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and
you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.</li>
</ol>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1"/>
        <updated>2013-01-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon
US</a> for the first time? You know, that big
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> conference taking place near San Francisco
in March?</p>
<p>Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being
overwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?</p>
<p>No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out
of attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm
going to share how to get through the whole event in good shape and
cover some incredible beginner friendly events.</p>
<h1>The Basics</h1>
<p>First off, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/">register</a>
already! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left
out in the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!</p>
<p>Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/">tutorials</a>, three days
of <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/">talks</a>, and four days of
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/">sprints</a>. <strong>Nine days of
Python!</strong> The trick is to not get exhausted or sick. Therefore, do the
following every day of the conference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take at least one shower. Please.</li>
<li>Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different
people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!</li>
<li>Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your
brain is going to go into learning overdrive.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, PyCon US also has a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/">code of
conduct</a>. I like to
sum it up as, "Act professionally." Whether or not you agree with
codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be
enforced.</p>
<p>Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!</p>
<h1>Tutorials</h1>
<p>Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but
are well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best
suited for beginners.</p>
<h2>Wednesday Morning</h2>
<ol>
<li>For novice programmers start with Jessica McKellar's <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/1/">A hands-on
introduction to Python for beginning
programmers</a>. I
can vouch that the instructor is amazing, and will jumpstart you on
the road to being a Python developer.</li>
<li>Are you an experienced developer new to Python? I suggest <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/8/">Going
from web pages to web apps with
Python</a> by
Asheesh Loroia and Karen Rustad. In 2009 I took a class by Asheesh
and was impressed by his energy, enthusiasm, and depth of knowledge.</li>
<li>Want to learn Python web that isn't Django? Try out Paul Everitt's
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/12/">Pyramid for
Humans</a> class.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Wednesday Afternoon</h2>
<ol>
<li>You simply can't go wrong with David Beazley's <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/2/">Learn Python
Through Public Data
Hacking</a>. He's
the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">Python Essential
Reference</a>,
an amazing instructor, and delivered a PyCon keynote last year.</li>
<li>If you're interested in the web, check out Nathan Yergler's
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/9/">Effective
Django</a>. I can
assure you that he knows his Django material and is going to deliver
a great experience.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Thursday Morning</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you're new to Python, you need to learn the Python environment.
This means version control, PyPI, test automation, and more. Matt
Harrison covers this in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/3/">Scripting: from Hard-drive to Github to
PyPI</a></li>
<li>Getting back to the web, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/10/">Fully Test-Driven Web Development with
Django and
Selenium</a> is
another run through the Django tutorial, but done from the test
driven perspective.</li>
<li>A fascinating tutorial offered at this time is <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/30/">A Gentle
Introduction to Computer
Vision</a>. It's
a great way to learn how Python is used in many creative and
unexpected ways.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Thursday Afternoon</h2>
<ol>
<li>Jessica McKellar returns to instruct on how to give back to the
community with <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/4/">Contribute with me! Getting started with open source
development</a>.</li>
<li>Want to learn how to program games? Look no further than Richard
Jones' <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/19/">Introduction to
PyGame</a>. He's
taught this class for years, and I can't say enough good things
about him.</li>
<li>This talk is not meant for beginning Django developers, but it's
useful anyway. <a href="https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/">Kenneth Love</a>
and <a href="https://jacobian.org">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> are presenting <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/">Wiring
Up Django
Packages</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Evening Activities</h1>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/two-scoops-django-faq-20130121"/>
        <updated>2013-01-21T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/"><img src="/images/tsd15-frontispiece.png" alt="Frontispiece for TSD 1.5"></a></p>
<p>The launch of the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.5</a> book has gone pretty well. The response
has been almost entirely positive and sales have been pretty brisk.
We've gotten a ton of great, constructive editorial feedback, which
we're sorting through as we race towards the BETA release. Here are
answers to the commonly asked questions:</p>
<h2>When can I buy the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> via PayPal?</h2>
<p>We now support PayPal. The next part is the historical text that no longer applies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to handle PayPal we need to find a reputable e-publisher that supports it that gives us similar rates, customer service, and product control (updates at any time, uploads of PDF, no surprise charges, etc) as <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>. If you know of an e-publisher who is willing to provide that same level of service, please let me know.</p>
<p>For the record, we aren't leaving <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>. We just want to support developers and students who don't have credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> While we could certainly write our own publishing platform, that would delay work on the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a>. ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>When can I get a Kindle (mobi) or ePub version?</h2>
<p>Our plan is to support those formats in either the BETA or FINAL
releases. In fact, I really love my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20">Kindle</a>.
I can't wait to proof my own <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> on my
favorite reading device.</p>
<h2>When can I get a print version?</h2>
<p>We hope to have a print version in about 30 days. We need to ensure that
the cover and layout actually looks nice, and that involves ordering
copies from the Lulu, CreateSpace, whatever and reviewing them and
making corrections. Then ordering again to make sure the corrections
look okay. That simply takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>We are hoping for a mid-February release. Also, keep in mind we aren't
sure yet if we'll do a print version of anything but a FINAL release.</p>
<h2>When are the BETA and FINAL releases?</h2>
<p>As soon as possible.</p>
<p>We can't make promises, but at the latest, the FINAL <em>should</em> be done
by the start of March so people have them in hand at PyCon US.</p>
<h2>Is this book going to get updated?</h2>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>In fact, we've already sent out three minor updates for grammar and
spelling issues, and some bug fixes. Even after the FINAL version comes
out, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of
self-published books is we have control of content.</p>
<h2>How much work went into the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a>?</h2>
<p><a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a> and I put in hundreds of hours writing
and testing the content. We worked 12-16 hour days for weeks. It was
madness, but a glorious madness. We became like hermits and toiled on
the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> while ignoring distractions like
sleep, food and consistent exercise.</p>
<p>Our amazing technical reviewers also worked very hard to provide us with
critical commentary, advice and corrections.</p>
<h2>Where should I send errata?</h2>
<p>Please send errata to <a href="mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. The first person who
reports an issue or makes a suggestion that we adopt will receive credit
in the book. If not in the changelog, then in the dialogue of the book
itself.</p>
<h2>Are you going to PyCon US?</h2>
<p>Absolutely! Wouldn't miss <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a> for
the world! <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">Audrey</a> and I met and fell in love at
PyCon US 2010! We'll be there for at least the second day of tutorials,
all the talks, and all the
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/">sprints</a>. I've even got
a blog post coming that should serve as a guide for beginning Python and
Django developers attending the event.</p>
<p><em>Shameless Plug:</em> We're both speaking and giving a tutorial. Sign up
for the tutorial or attend our talks!</p>
<h3><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/">Wiring Up Django Packages</a> (Tutorial)</h3>
<p>You just finished the Django tutorial. What do you do now? You wire in
Django Packages! Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages,
which can be leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the
evaluation, use, and extension of third party Python and Django
applications in your projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a
lot of detailed and annotated code examples. Instructors are <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">Audrey
Roy Greenfeld</a>, Daniel Roy Greenfeld, and <a href="https://brack3t.com/">Kenneth
Love</a> (of <a href="https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/">Getting Started with
Django</a> fame).</p>
<h2><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/101/">Advanced Django Forms Usage</a> (Talk)</h2>
<p>Django forms are really powerful but there are edge cases, especially
with class based views), that can cause a bit of anguish. This talk will
go over how to handle many common solutions not currently described in
the core documentation. It will also cover useful third-party libraries.
Speaker is Daniel Roy Greenfeld.</p>
<h2><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/">Using Python To Generate Art And Sound</a> (Talk)</h2>
<p>The trick to navigating the overwhelming Python audio/imaging landscape
is understanding how the fundamentals work, using common data
processing/visualization libraries, in-depth code samples, and simple
math operations. I use the stdlib, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PIL, and
PyCairo to create building blocks, which I then combine to demonstrate
advanced sound and image generation techniques. Speaker is <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey
Roy Greenfeld</a>.</p>
<h2>Are you going to Django Circus?</h2>
<p>We hope so. <a href="https://2013.djangocon.eu/">Django Circus</a>, a.k.a. DjangoCon
Europe, is one of the important industry events for us and we're trying
to figure out logistics.</p>
<p>Our problem is that 2012 was a very hard year - the majority of our
clients have not paid for the work that we did. Collecting is turning
out to be extremely difficult, time consuming, and unpleasant. This is
impacting everything we want to do in 2013.</p>
<h2>How does the ALPHA work?</h2>
<p>The ALPHA is a preview version that we are selling at an introductory
price of $12. When you purchase the ALPHA, you get access to the BETA
and FINAL versions when they are released.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, we are planning to increase the price of the
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> when we release the BETA and FINAL
versions.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/our-django-book-is-launched"/>
        <updated>2013-01-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/"><img src="/images/tsd15-alpha.png" alt="Original TSD Book Cover"></a></p>
<p>We (<a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">Audrey Roy</a> and I) wrote a
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> on Django! It's called <strong>Two Scoops
of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</strong>, and you can buy it right now
in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5</a>.</p>
<p>Django, like any framework, has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't
documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but
gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take
everything we know and write it down. This
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> reflects a portion of what we
documented, and if it does well we plan to follow it up with other
references.</p>
<p>If you've followed this blog or watched our talks you've know we've
explained tons of Django and Python related examples. We enjoy using
Django and Python to build stable, fast web applications quickly and
efficiently. This is the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> we would have
wanted while learning the intricacies of our tools, and then kept it
handy for reference.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a> we cover everything from
customizing the Django 1.5 User model, forms, views, templates,
security, bottleneck analysis and so much more. We tie in third-party
packages from the Django and Python community. We discuss the positive
patterns that allow for rapid development, and point out the
anti-patterns that cause problems. The result isn't a walk-through or
tutorial, but a reference guide for anyone with at least a basic
understanding of Django.</p>
<p>We tried to make the code copy/pastable, but we are constrained by the
limits of PDF. While the code examples display nicely, <em>when pasting
from Adobe Reader the leading white spaces vanish</em>. We apologize and ask
if anyone knows how to address this issue to let us know at
<a href="mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>.</p>
<p>Even with an amazing cadre of technical reviewers, there is always the
possibility of errors. We are going to be actively maintaining the
<a href="https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5">book</a>, so if you find a mistake, let us know
and we'll update it and send out an updated copy of the PDF to all
buyers.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/new-years-python-meme</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/new-years-python-meme"/>
        <updated>2012-12-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tarek Ziade has a habit of ending the year with a Python-themed meme.
I've matched his meme the times he previousstarted it, and as you can
tell from the title of this blog post I'm matching him yet again.</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2012?
===========================================================================================</li>
</ol>
<p>This question took some thought. It was a toss-up between these three
choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django Class Based Views (CBVs) allow developers do amazing things
with Django, but needed some polish (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/">improved
documentation</a>,
<a href="https://django-braces.readthedocs.org/">missing functionality</a>) to
be able to shine.</li>
<li><a href="https://reportlab.org">ReportLab</a> for generating PDF allowed me to
create some <a href="https://www.petcheatsheets.com/">impressive results</a>,
but the API needed updating. The other Python PDF libraries might be
better, but getting images to work trivially in them</li>
<li>If I didn't completely agree with <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/12/29/sql-is-agile/">Armin Ronacher on the
subject</a>, I might
have gone with a combination of
<a href="https://api.mongodb.org/python/">PyMongo</a>,
<a href="https://mongoengine.org/">MongoEngine</a>, and
<a href="https://namlook.github.com/mongokit/">MongoKit</a>. Just like Armin,
I've learned through working with schemaless databases to know that
schemas are awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>The winner?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Django Class Based Views</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2012 what I managed to accomplish with Django CBVs was incredible.
From early self-instructional work I did for
<a href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-mongonaut/blob/master/mongonaut/views.py">django-mongonaut</a>,
to client efforts and personal projects where I honed my craft, plus
examples <a href="/tag/class-based-views.html">I blogged
about</a> or helped get
into Django core, it made for a great year. Also I wasn't just
productive personally, I helped increased the productivity of others
around the world.</p>
<p>And you ain't seen nothing yet!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?
========================================================</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought I understood multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>However, since the start of this year I've delved really deep into it,
only to discover just how much I didn't know. While that didn't do my
ego any favors, it was a nice refreshing reminder not to get arrogant
about one's skills.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?
=====================================================================================</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to this is <strong>Django</strong>.</p>
<p>After using Django professionally for 2.5 years, I finally began
contributing to the core framework at the DjangoCon Eu 2012 sprints. I
joined a group of other dedicated people who decided to improve the
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/">Django CBV
documentation</a>,
our goal being setting a new standard for documentation. I'm not sure
if we set a new bar in documentation, but we did improve on the existing
material.</p>
<p>I branched out into some other areas of core Django development with
mixed results, which played out that way because I just didn't have the
time to do more.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?
==============================================================</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, <a href="https://planet.python.org">https://planet.python.org</a>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?
===========================================================</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really advanced Python as taught by Raymond Hettiger or David
Beazley.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really want to learn <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to do an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%BA#A.C3.BA">Aú sem
Mão</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013?
=========================================================================================</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I've got a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Python SDK that produces results that work perfectly for both
modern iOS and Android. Think Corona SDK but with Python.</li>
<li>A modern PyGame release that installs trivially on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Want to do your own list? here's how:</h1>
<ul>
<li>copy-paste the questions and answer to them in your blog</li>
<li>tweet it with the
<a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%232012pythonmeme&#x26;src=typd">#2012pythonmeme</a>
hashtag</li>
</ul>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/developer-time</id>

        <updated>2012-12-04T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog post got started with a tweet.</p>
<p>That tweet got retweeted a lot by developers. And system administrators.
And database administrators. And any creative type.</p>
<p>As of December 7th, 2012, it had been retweeted over 500 times, a
personal best. Obviously I struck a chord that resonated with a lot of
people.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Developers should have 4-6 hours of uninterrupted activity each day. Each 3-5 minute interruption costs more than you can imagine.</p>&mdash; Daniel Greenfeld (@pydanny) <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny/status/275680738773463040" data-datetime="2012-12-03T19:19:44+00:00">December 3, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Why did this tweet resonate with so many people?
================================================
<p>What I said in that tweet was not new - dozens if not hundreds of others
have tweeted similar thoughts before and gotten many retweets. Heck,
it's been written about in blogs and articles for years, either as a
huge rant or often as an effort to politely educate others on how to set
up a developer/operations/creative shop.</p>
<p>I think this is because developers/engineers/creatives (and good
managers) know that even a tiny distraction to someone "in the zone"
takes more than just the 3-5 minutes it takes for you to finish a
question and get an answer. Plus, because you are trying to remember the
pieces in your head, you won't be able to give this issue your full
attention. Which causes a whole other set of issues.</p>
<p>We know this. Good managers know this. Good companies live off of it.</p>
<p>And yet this remains a huge problem for many of us because the
distractions keep happening. Maybe it's because your manager doesn't
understand this issue, or you have a team mate who can switch in-and-out
of the zone with impunity. Or because you foolishly leave the
chat/IRC/phone on and you get pinged.</p>
<h1>How do we fix it?</h1>
<p><strong>We can't.</strong></p>
<p>I know this sounds depressing, but I'm being realistic. Here's some
reasons that apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are fortunate enough to be working on a solo effort, you
are working with other developers/engineers/creatives. And if they
can't ask you questions or inform you about critical stuff then you
or they can waste hours.</li>
<li>Meetings, short or long, online or in person, are a necessary part
of any operation. If not with your boss or underlings, then with
clients or users.</li>
<li>Your boss/co-workers/underlings/kids/pets/parents don't get it that
you can't be interrupted.</li>
<li>As a freelancer, you can't be inaccessible to existing or potential
clients.</li>
</ul>
<h1>No really, how do we fix it?</h1>
<p>Doesn't matter how frequently you ask the the question (or rant about
it), I don't believe this problem can be really solved. However, here
are some possible mitigations:</p>
<p><strong>1. Maker's Day</strong></p>
<p>My friend, <a href="https://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day/">Craig
Kerstiens</a>
describes how <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> gives engineers a full day
each week (Thursday) to focus on getting stuff done. No meetings, no
standup, just 100% uninterrupted quiet time to focus on making stuff.</p>
<p>Suggest this at your company and see how it goes!</p>
<p><strong>2. Blocks of Time</strong></p>
<p>As of 2010, <a href="https://eldarion.com">Eldarion</a> broke up their work day into
at least two sizable chunks of uninterrupted activity. Between the
chunks you communicated with co-workers. The advantage of this approach
is if you went down the wrong path or someone had a critical question,
the period between chunks addressed this issue.</p>
<p>In theory this is how a lot of places work (lunch being the break). The
reality is that the distractions often still pile in. For Eldarion it
worked because everyone was remote.</p>
<p><strong>3. New Desk Location</strong></p>
<p>If working at an office, asked to be moved to a place with less foot
traffic. The downside to this is you can end up in noisy, cold, dark
places.</p>
<p><strong>4. New Job</strong></p>
<p>Switch to a new job that promises less distractions.</p>
<h1>Maybe I'm wrong</h1>
<p>I'm more than happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a way to get 4-6 hours a day of uninterrupted maker's
time every work day.</p>
<p>If you've got any ideas, let me know!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One virtue of Django Class Based Views (CBVs) is that they come with
pretty good default settings. The virtue of this is you can really pare
your code down in size and complexity.</p>
<p>For example, here is an implementation of CBVs based on a
straight-forward Django model , <code>stuffage.models.Stuff</code>, that has a
<code>get_absolute_url</code> method:</p>
<p><strong>stuffage/views.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views import generic

from stuffage.models import Stuff

class StuffDetailView(generic.DetailView):
    model = Stuff

class StuffListView(generic.ListView):
    model = Stuff

class StuffCreateView(generic.CreateView):
    model = Stuff

class StuffUpdateView(generic.UpdateView):
    model = Stuff
</code></pre>
<p><strong>stuffage/urls.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url, include

from stuffage import views

urlpatterns = patterns("",

    url(
        regex=r"^create/$",
        view=views.StuffCreateView.as_view(),
        name="stuff_create",
    ),
    url(
        regex=r"^update/(?P&#x3C;pk>\d+)/$",
        view=views.StuffUpdateView.as_view(),
        name="stuff_update",
    ),
    url(
        regex=r"^(?P&#x3C;pk>\d+)/$",
        view=views.StuffDetailView.as_view(),
        name="stuff_detail",
    ),
    url(
        regex=r"^$",
        view=views.StuffListView.as_view(),
        name="stuff_list",
    ),
)
</code></pre>
<p>These four CBVs will default to the following three templates without
any action on my part:</p>
<pre><code>stuffage/stuff_detail.html (StuffDetailView)
stuffage/stuff_form.html (StuffCreateView, StuffUpdateView)
stuffage/stuff_list.html (StuffListView)
</code></pre>
<p>So easy I use a simple script to render all this code!</p>
<h1>What about doing this all in the urls.py?</h1>
<p>Yes, I could do this all in the urls.py, but real Django code involves
doing some logic in views, no matter how skinny you try to make said
views. While I'm a huge proponent of logic in fat models, invariably
I'm adding to the view context, or doing something else that requires
tweaking of CBV settings.</p>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>One trait of developers is we like to <strong>tinker</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I keep seeing developers tinkering on the settings for
Django CBVs without any reason besides tinkeringWhich means you get
things like:</p>
<p><strong>unfortunately tinkered stuffage/views.py</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># 1. Using template_name means extra code and extra developer lookup time.
# 2. Changing the context_object_name means extra code  and extra developer     
#       lookup time.
class StuffDetailView(generic.DetailView):
    model = Stuff
    template_name = "stuffage/stuffs.html"
    context_object_name = 'stuff'
</code></pre>
<p><strong>unfortunately tinkered stuffage/urls.py</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># 1. Logic into your URLConf should be kept to a minimum
# 2. Unless you are using the same view more than once, specifying the
#       template_name here is a waste of code. And makes it harder to
#       understand the view.
url(
    regex=r"^$",
    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(template_name="stuffage/stuffs.html"),
    name="stuff_list",
),

# No matter how fat your models get, you always end up extending all views,
#   so this will have to be moved into the formal views.py at some point. So
#   why not start with it in the views.py in the first place.
url(
    regex=r"^$",
    view=ListView.as_view(
        model=Stuff,
        template_name="stuffage/stuffs.html"),
    name="stuff_list",
),
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget you can also tinker/tweak formats and slug/pk identifier
defaults, and a ton of other things that are part of Django CBVs. While
this gives you great power, if misused that power can cause grief in
terms of code obfuscation and the need for additional testing.</p>
<p>My opinion is that these defaults were meant as a standard for the CBV
to operate, upon which developers familiar with the Django CBV API could
extend and expand their code for minimal effort. Yes, you can tweak them
to match your preferred patterns, but that's extra work. Work you
shouldn't be doing if you can avoid it.</p>
<h1>My Advice</h1>
<p>Stick with the defaults and only modify behavior that actually needs to
be modified. For example, if you want to show multiple versions of a
ListView you might do something like:</p>
<p><strong>stuffage/urls.py with a pydanny approved use of template_name</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">url(
    regex=r"^$",
    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(),
    name="stuff_list",
),

# Same view but with a template designed to show larger list items.
url(
    regex=r"^large/$",
    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(template_name="stuffage/stuff_list_large.html"),
    name="stuff_list_large",
),
</code></pre>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This is the pattern I follow when I build projects. I stick to the
framework standard as much as possible. Since many systems rely on
convention over configuration, this makes it easier and faster to
develop projects, be it Django, Twisted, or some other tool.</p>
<p>It's the work you can see in my <a href="https://petcheatsheets.com">recent</a>
<a href="https://movehero.io">public</a> <a href="https://lacurrents.com">projects</a>, and what
I want to port to long existing sites like <a href="https://djangopackages.com">Django
Packages</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'll admit it, I love a good rant. I respect those who can give rants
well. I would list the ones I really like, but I'm not sure I want to
deal with the arguments that would follow. ;-)</p>
<p>Of course, as much as I like to read or listen to them, I also like to
give them. As of 11/26/2012 there are 2 on this
<a href="/tag/rant.html">blog</a> and 26 on my <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/rant">old
blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a problem in giving rants. It ties with this
unfortunate trait I possess where if I let myself get angry I say things
that destroy relationships. No, I'm not giving examples, but there you
are.</p>
<p>So when I do rant, I try to never do so in anger. Especially when it's
the written word. Instead, I try to do so under one of the following
conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to be a whimsical mood.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to submit a solution.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to accept a solution, even if it means work.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to create a solution.</li>
<li>OR the object of the rant must be an easy target to flame.</li>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/casestudy-urls"/>
        <updated>2012-11-21T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Backstory:</strong> On Saturday, November 17, 2012 Audrey
Roy and I decided to participate in the
<a href="https://twitter.com/petcentric">Petcentric</a> hackathon, a Los Angeles
area Pet-themed product/coding contest held at
<a href="https://www.amplify.la/">Amplify</a>. We arrived a bit late, but armed with
Audrey's idea of creating a pet based reference sheet for owners, pet
sitters, vets, and anyone else needing a card with data on pets, we got
to work. About eight hours later we toggled a DNS switch and
<a href="https://www.petcheatsheets.com">petcheatsheets.com</a> was live.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Pet Cheatsheet's owner's pet information is private,
because it includes emergency contact information that often includes
phone numbers, email addresses, and even physical addresses of family
members and friends. Maintaining the privacy of pets and their owners
was also a consideration in implementation.</p>
<h1>URL Design Thoughts</h1>
<p>During development, one of the things I considered carefully was URL
design of the primary feature, which was pets. The obvious choice was to
go with a design that identified owners with pets:</p>
<pre><code>/&#x3C;owner_username>/&#x3C;pet_name>/
</code></pre>
<p>However, upon reflection, this didn't sit well with me. What if a pet
changed owners? Identifying a pet with a particular owner in the URL
meant that if we ever added a 'transfer ownership' feature, there
would be extra work. Also, if we ever implemented a sharing feature,
changing URLs on a pet going to the same veterinarian their whole life
might make the veterinarian's list of pets and their URLs invalid.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I decided to go with an identifier and pet name,
where the pet name was actually not used in the lookup:</p>
<pre><code>/&#x3C;pet_id>/&#x3C;pet_name:not_required>/
</code></pre>
<p>One more thing, rather than just use the <strong>pet</strong> table's primary key as
<code>&#x3C;pet_id></code> I decided to go with base36 (0-9 and a-z) encoding. It's not
unlike what URL shortening services do, and if we gained any traction,
it makes recitation of a pet's URL easier. So the final result was
actually:</p>
<pre><code>/&#x3C;pet_id:base_36_encoded>/&#x3C;pet_name:not_required>/
</code></pre>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Here's a simplified view of the final implementation, starting with the
model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># pets/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

class Pet(models.Model):

    name = models.CharField(_("Pet's name"), max_length=100)
    identifier = models.CharField(_("identifier"), max_length=50,
        null=True, blank=True, db_index=True)
    # More fields...
</code></pre>
<p>Then the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># pets/forms.py
from django import forms

from pets.models import Pet

class PetForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Pet
        fields = ('name', ) # more fields
</code></pre>
<p>With model and form, we build the views:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># pets/views.py
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.utils.baseconv import base36
from django.views.generic import CreateView, DetailView, UpdateView

from braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin

from pets.forms import PetForm

class PetCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):

    model = Pet
    form_class = PetForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        pet = form.save()
        pet.identifier = base36.encode(pet.pk)
        pet.owner = self.request.user
        # Save again - it's not taking THAT many server cycles AND we needed
        #    the pet.pk in advance to generate the pet.identifier
        pet.save()
        return super(PetCreateView, self).form_valid(form)


class GetPetMixin(object):
    """ Any view that needs to get a Pet object can use this Mixin

        Pet Cheatsheet's owner's pet information is private, because it
            includes emergency contact information that often includes phone
            numbers, email addresses, and even physical addresses of family
            members and friends.
    """

    def get_object(self):
        pet = get_object_or_404(Pet, identifier=self.kwargs['identifier'])

        if pet.owner != self.request.user:
            # Rather than a 'forbidden' result, we want to show a 'Pet Not
            #    Found' page so we can educate site users.
            raise Http404
        return pet

class PetDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, DetailView):
    pass

class PetUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Pet
    form_class = PetForm

class PetPDFView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, DetailView):
    model = Pet

    # snip: lots of code for rendering the PDFs.
</code></pre>
<p>Then we wire up the views into the urls:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url

from pets import views

urlpatterns = patterns("",

    url(
        regex=r"^build-cheatsheet/$",
        view=views.PetCreateView.as_view(),
        name="pet_create",
    ),
    url(
        regex=r"^update/(?P&#x3C;identifier>[\w\d]+)/(?P&#x3C;slug>[\w\d\-\_]+)/$",
        view=views.PetUpdateView.as_view(),
        name="pet_update",
    ),
    url(
        regex=r"^(?P&#x3C;identifier>[\w\d]+)/(?P&#x3C;slug>[\w\d\-\_]+)/$",
        view=views.PetDetailView.as_view(),
        name="pet_detail",
    ),
    # snip: a lot of other views
)
</code></pre>
<h1>Result</h1>
<p>In the image below you can see how Marko's URL has his own unique
identifier, along with his name. I can change the name in the URL or
even in the database, but so long as I don't modify the identifying
part of the URL (<code>1m</code>), his information always shows up.</p>

        <updated>2012-10-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to use the Django class based view (CBV) CreateView, but
I wanted to avoid duplications and submit to the view from the front
page of a site. The reason was I needed a simple newsletter signup form.
This is what I cooked up and should work for Django 1.3, 1.4, and the
forthcoming 1.5 release. Here is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installed dependencies
=========================</li>
</ol>
<p>This version requires the following package to be pip installed into
your virtualenv.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions">django-extensions</a>
so we can have easy timestamps on models.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also needs to be added to your list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">INSTALLED_APPS += (
    'django_extensions',
)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Defined the model
====================</li>
</ol>
<p>The model is really simple, and inherits from TimeStampedModel so we
know when people signed up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.db import models

from django_extensions.db.models import TimeStampedModel

class NewsLetterSignup(TimeStampedModel):

    email = models.EmailField("Email")

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.email
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Wrote the view
=================</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the somewhat challenging part that forced me to dive into
Django's source code. Even with the documentation work we've done over
the past few months, it's clear we've got a long way to go.</p>
<p>Because of that source code diving, for this blog post I really did my
best to document why I did things in the
<code>NewsLetterSignupView.form_valid()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.views.generic import CreateView

from .models import NewsLetterSignup

class NewsLetterSignupView(CreateView):
    """ Signs up users to a newsletter """

    model = NewsLetterSignup
    success_url = '/newsletter-signed-up/'  # replace with reverse

    def form_valid(self, form):
        """
        If the form is valid, save the associated model.
            (django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin)
        If the form is valid, redirect to the supplied URL.
            (django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin)
        """

        # Get the email from the form.cleaned_data dictionary
        email = form.cleaned_data.get("email", "")

        # Get or create the signup. We don't need to do anything with the
        #   model instance or created boolean so we don't set them.
        NewsLetterSignup.objects.get_or_create(email=email)  

        # Don't use super() to inherit as it will do a form.save()
        # You could call the FormMixin's form_valid() method but I think    
        #   using a HttpResponseRedirect() much more explicit.
        return HttpResponseRedirect(self.success_url)  
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Wired it together
====================</li>
</ol>
<p>In urls.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

from .views import NewsLetterSignupView

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(regex=r'^newsletter-signed-up/$',
        view=TemplateView.as_view(
            template_name="pages/newsletter_signed_up.html"
        ),
        name='newsletter_signedup',
    ),
    url(regex=r'^newsletter-signup/$',
        view=NewsLetterSignupView.as_view(),
        name='news_letter_signup',
    ),
)
</code></pre>
<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>
<p>First off, you'll notice I didn't include the
<code>pages/newsletter_signed_up.html</code> because for this case it's too
trivial.</p>
<p>Second, this is one of those very clear cases where a functional view
would have been so much easier compared to the effort I spent writing
this as a class based view. The line count would have been about the
same, but the mental bandwidth involved in figuring this would have been
a fraction of the effort I spent.</p>
<p>Third, this is probably better served with an implementation of
<code>django.views.generic.FormView</code>. Oh well...</p>
<p>Fourth, I want to see a configurable version of this in the next release
of <a href="https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/">django-braces</a>. ;-)</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/la-open-source-5"/>
        <updated>2012-10-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/"><img src="/images/la_hackathons.jpeg" alt="Hacking awayyy!!"></a></p>
<p>Yet again, myself, Audrey Roy, and a small but elite cadre of volunteers
are feverishly at work putting together another Los Angeles open source
event. Our <a href="/july-15th-2012-la-open-source-recap.html">last effort went smashingly
well</a>, and
like any good engineer, we're ready to scale up - this time to 150
attendees!</p>
<p>LA Open Source #5 is a day long coding event for Open Source developers
of all languages and skill levels to come and code like fiends. They'll
be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or nice people like
me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and more!</p>
<p>RSVP at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/</a></p>
<p>I'll be there to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-lead the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles
technical community!</li>
<li>Code like a fiend. I plan to work on core
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. Maybe some ember.js stuff too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>
<h2>When and where?</h2>
<p>Where:</p>
<pre><code>Cross Campus (crosscamp.us)
820 Broadway
Santa Monica, CA
</code></pre>
<p>When:</p>
<pre><code>November 4th, 2012
10 AM to 9 PM
</code></pre>
<h2>Is this like a Hackathon?</h2>
<p>Yup. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints</a></p>
<h2>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</h2>
<p>Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join
and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. The current
list of projects include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django - in fact, this time we've got at least one core Django
developer!</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Rails</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Pyramid</li>
<li>Salt Stack</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<h2>I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?</h2>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p><strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place. Instead,
you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In
fact, here's a good <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/">bi-weekly hack night / study
group</a> for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great way to
learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced
developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are
called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for
beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at
events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other
things that have made me a better coder.</p>
<h2>Can I come and do one of the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recruit.</li>
<li>Get people to work on my private project.</li>
<li>Get people to work on my start-up idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a job fair or way to get free developers services, and we
don't want unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we mention you on the
official event description, in social media and many other perks. To bad this event occured years ago.</p>
<p>In addition, we're considering future events that mix in business into
our efforts. If you're interested in that sort of thing then stay tuned
for more announcements.</p>
<h2>What about sponsorship?</h2>
<p>In return for sponsorship we mention your organization or person on the
official event description, and provide many other perks including
mention in social media.</p>
<p>In fact, our attendees are well-noted for their feverish support of
sponsors. Developer-only open source events are rare in Los Angeles, so
attendees are incredibly grateful to those who make the event possible.</p>
<p>If interested, keep in mind this event happened years ago.</p>
<h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
<p>Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,
the venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to
bring a power strip labeled with your name.</p>
<h2>I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?</h2>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/need-more-pycon-submissions</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/need-more-pycon-submissions"/>
        <updated>2012-09-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PyCon US 2013 <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/">call for papers
(CFP)</a> ends tomorrow, September
28th, 2012. We need more talk and tutorial submissions. Talks are 30 or
45 minute efforts in front of the PyCon audience and are recorded for
posterity. Tutorials are three hours long and are given to attendees who
have paid an additional fee in order to slurp in knowledge from the
masters.</p>
<p>On the 3 hour tutorial side of things, <strong>we especially need more Intro
to Python level submission</strong>. That means getting beginners up to speed
on basic Python techniques, so they can then exploit the other
tutorials, conference, and sprints to their full advantage.</p>
<h1>Now onto some questions...</h1>
<ol>
<li>I would like to give a tutorial but it's so much work to put together 3 hours of quality content.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The organizers of PyCon recognize that putting together a quality
tutorial is an amazing amount of work. Which is why tutorial presenters
are compensated for their effort.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What is the most likely length talk to be accepted? 30 minutes or 45 minutes?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The vast majority of PyCon sessions are 30 minutes long, so 45 minute
slots are rare and valuable commodities. So if your talk needs to be 45
minutes long your proposal has to really speak to the PyCon talk
reviewers.</p>
<p>Not only that, if reviewers send you information requests for any
duration talk or tutorial, <strong>you dramatically increase your odds of talk
acceptance with timely responses</strong>.</p>
<p>And, as said before, PyCon really needs more <strong>introductory level Python
tutorial</strong> submissions.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I would like to present a talk or tutorial but I can't afford to come to PyCon.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>PyCon's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&#x26;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ">financial aid
program</a>
is said to favor accepted speakers to PyCon. They really want you to
come!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I would like to present but I can't come up with a good idea!</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I had this problem as well! Then I looked at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/tutorials/suggested_topics_2012/">Suggested Tutorial
Topics</a> and
got some ideas.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Ack! I've got a talk idea but it's going to take me too much time to put it together!</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Submit the talk anyway before the talk and in fields you aren't ready
to fill in, simply put '<strong>TBD</strong>'. Then over the course of the next few
days replace TBD with real material. Don't wait too long though to fix
those TBDs, no more than a week!</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>I'm a beginner/nobody in the community, is there any chance my proposal will get accepted?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong></p>
<p>The PyCon talk/tutorial reviewers love to see new people present. While
experienced/proven speakers have an edge, good talk/tutorial proposals
from promising candidates <strong>can</strong> make it into the conference. Carefully
double-check your submission, be responsive to reviewers, and stay
positive. I'm not saying you will get in, but I am saying it's worth
the effort.</p>
<h1>Good luck!</h1>
<p>PyCon 2013 is going to be bigger and better than any previous year.
That's because we pull together as a community to run an amazing event
that is known to jumpstart careers and cause amazing life changes. We
can't do this without you, so hurry up on your <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/">PyCon US 2013
submissions</a>!</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/installing-pycairo-on-mac-osx"/>
        <updated>2012-09-04T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cairographics.org/pycairo/">Pycairo</a> is the binding for the
<a href="https://cairographics.org/">cairo graphics library</a>. It's also not
something you can get running with a simple <code>pip install py2cairo</code>.
After many hours of working the search engines and dancing to the
configure/make/make install melody, I figured out an answer that worked
for me.</p>
<h1>Step 1 - Install GCC</h1>
<p>If you don't have it yet, go get
<a href="https://github.com/downloads/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/GCC-10.7-v2.pkg">https://github.com/downloads/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/GCC-10.7-v2.pkg</a>
and install it. It's 200 MB so make sure you have a fast connection
and/or a good place to wait.</p>
<h1>Step 2 - Install Homebrew</h1>
<p>I use Homebrew instead of Macports. If you don't have it yet, paste
this in a terminal prompt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruby &#x3C;(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)
</code></pre>
<h1>Step 3 - Install Cairo</h1>
<p>In your terminal prompt, type the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ brew install cairo --use-clang
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get some messages about LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS in build variables,
but that's only important if you skip Homebrew and build your own
software later that interacts with <strong>cairo</strong>.</p>
<h1>Step 4 - Install Pycairo itself</h1>
<p>The nasty little trick to this is to remember that <strong>Pycairo</strong> is
packaged on it's site and other places as <strong>py2cairo</strong>. When they get
around to releasing version 3 of Pycairo, I'm going to beg and plead
that they follow an obvious naming system for their bundles. I know this
is done in other communities, but it's frustrating and a real barrier
for getting into a project.</p>
<p>In case, in your terminal prompt, type the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ brew install py2cairo
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a non-Homebrew installed Python like I do, you have to
set the PYTHONPATH to find pycairo. Set your PYTHONPATH in your
.bashrc/.profile/.whatever to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH.
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it's the system Python, but for now I'm okay with it. If someone
has an easy recipe for alternative Python installations, I would love to
link to it.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-dictionary-as-class</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-dictionary-as-class"/>
        <updated>2012-09-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago, circa 1999, when I was working in a certain procedural
language I found a library that added objects to the language. It did so
by playing interesting tricks with key/value structures, which in
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> are called dictionaries. In 2005, as a new
Python user, I read something about how objects in Python are
essentially dictionaries with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactical
sugar</a>.</p>
<p>Well, today while driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I started
to try and figure out how to replicate object or class-like behavior
using Python dictionaries. In this exercise, I wanted to code out the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>methods with ability to write to self/this/whatever</li>
<li>inheritance</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The result isn't something I would use in production code, but it was
fun to write. Without further ado...</p>
<h1>I present the 'newclass' function!</h1>
<p>What <code>newclass</code> does is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Document implementation of inheritance.</li>
<li>Include a simple <code>set</code> method for setting attribute values to
self/this/whatever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-python">def newclass(**kwargs):
    """ Use kwargs.update() method to handle inheritance """

    def set(key, value):
        """ Sets key/value to the kwargs.
            Replicates self/this clumsily
        """
        kwargs[key] = value
    kwargs['set'] = set
    return kwargs
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you've seen the code, let's try it out.</p>
<h2>Demonstration: Methods with ability to write to self/this/whatever</h2>
<p>Instantiating a <code>newclass</code> 'object' is straight-forward. See below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> person = newclass(
...     name="Danny",
...     mental_age=4,
... )
>>> print(person)
{'mental_age': 4, 'set': &#x3C;function set at 0x10bc902a8>, 'name': 'Danny'}
>>> person['set']("languages", ['Python', 'JavaScript'])
>>> print(person)
{'languages': ['Python', 'JavaScript'], 'mental_age': 4, 'set': &#x3C;function set at 0x10bc902a8>, 'name': 'Danny'}    
</code></pre>
<p>Setting a value to an attribute can be done via the <code>set</code> method is not
pretty, but it works. Yes, you can shortcut <code>set</code>, but I wanted to see
if it worked. That it's working is important because since <code>set</code> works,
it means we can create much more complicated methods that touch on many
parts of the newclass object context.</p>
<p>Just like a normal Python <code>class</code> and <code>method</code>.</p>
<h2>Demonstration: Inheritance</h2>
<p>Here I show how to use the <code>dict.update()</code> method to display
inheritance. I'll demonstrate via the use of the Mammal/Cat/Dog
example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def Mammal(**kwargs):
    """ The mammal base class """

    # dict.update handles the role of inheritance
    kwargs.update(newclass())

    # Mammals have 4 legs
    kwargs['legs'] = 4

    # Using lambda cause I'm lazy.
    kwargs['say'] = lambda: NotImplemented
    return kwargs

def Cat(**kwargs):

    # dict.update handles the role of inheritance
    kwargs.update(Mammal())

    # Make a sound
    kwargs['say'] = lambda: "Meow"
    return kwargs

def Dog(**kwargs):

    # dict.update handles the role of inheritance
    kwargs.update(Mammal()) # dict.update handles the role of inheritance

    # Make a sound
    kwargs['say'] = lambda: "Bark"
    return kwargs
</code></pre>
<p>Alright, we have our code. What happens when we try it out?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> # first we try just the Mammal
>>> mammal = Mammal()
>>> print(mammal['say']())
NotImplemented
>>> print(mammal['legs'])
4
>>> # Now the Cat
>>> cat = Cat()
>>> print(cat['say']())
Meow
>>> print(cat['legs'])
4
>>> # Finally the dog
>>> dog = Dog()
>>> print(dog['say']())
Bark
>>> print(dog['legs'])
4
</code></pre>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Compared to normal Python classes the syntax is a little bit on the ugly
side. Yet this works and as I said earlier, it was fun to write.</p>
<p>Some questions...</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I change the name of the internal context variable from
<code>kwargs</code> to <code>self</code>?</li>
<li>How fast is <code>newclass</code> compared to the standard Python <code>class</code>
system?</li>
<li>What happens if you use <code>newclass</code> in a complex project?</li>
<li>Shouldn't I implement some way to track inheritance chains?
Wouldn't it be nice to know the parent of an object?</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, <a href="https://jessenoller.com/">Jesse Noller</a>, the chair of
PyCon US, suggested a meme, "<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013">PyCon 2013</a>
<strong>talks/tutorials I'd like to see</strong>". Here is my meme submission:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python Obfuscation Contest
=============================</li>
</ol>
<p>This <strong>certain-to-be-controversial talk idea</strong> would be where the
speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> code module that would have to display the
text of "<em>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're
Dutch.</em>" There would be a '<em>Expert</em>' category which would forbid the
eval/exec functions. The "<em>Anything Goes Category</em>" would allow use of
<strong>eval/exec</strong>. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces
the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Python in Space!!!!
======================</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or
research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen
scientists.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Template Language Shootout
=============================</li>
</ol>
<p>I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python
template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This
isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total
usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted,
debated, and expanded upon.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Python 3 from scratch
========================</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start,
you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should
be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with
migrating from 2.x to 3.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Fun and games with NumPy
===========================</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> is an incredible library. It deserves a
talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing.
Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social
data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and
impress me!</p>
<p>There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the "<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013">PyCon
2013</a> <strong>talks/tutorials I'd like to see</strong>"
meme. What do you want to see?</p>
<hr>
<p>And now it's time for...</p>
<h2>A Public Service Message to the Python Community</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-dictionary-vs-javascript-object</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/python-dictionary-vs-javascript-object"/>
        <updated>2012-08-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I noticed a long time ago with JavaScript is that when
you create objects you can define keys outside of strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">> var o = {city: "San Francisco"}
  Object
</code></pre>
<p>In JavaScript, this is valid. In Python, you'll get a <code>NameError</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> o = {city: "San Francisco"}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#x3C;input>", line 1, in &#x3C;module>
NameError: name 'city' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Normally this isn't too big of an issue, except when you want to use
JavaScript to create object keys based off of values in a variable.
Which means that while this code works fine in Python...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> region_name = 'state'
>>> o = {region_name: "Californa", "city": "San Francisco"}
>>> o["state"]
'Californa'
</code></pre>
<p>...it fails in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">> var region_name = 'state'
  "state"
> var o = {region_name: "Californa", "city": "San Francisco"}
  Object
> o["state"]
  undefined
> o["region_name"]
  "Californa"
</code></pre>
<p>What this means is that if you want to define object keys dynamically in
JavaScript, you need to add an extra line(s) of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">> var region_name = "state""
  "state"
> var o = {"city": "San Francisco"}
  Object     
> o[region_name] = "California" // Add dynamic key here
  "California"
> o["state"]

<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>Python is consistent in how it deals with named objects. If you
haven't named something, Python throws the <code>NameError</code>.</li>
<li>JavaScript seems to send out an <code>undefined</code> unless you are defining
an object.</li>

        <updated>2012-08-15T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little over three months ago <a href="/django-requirements-for-a-project.html">I blogged about my preferred
requirements</a>
list. It's now nearly the eve of <a href="https://djangodash.com">Django Dash</a>,
and I feel it's time to update the list. I'm going to bump the
versions on some of the existing packages and add some new ones to the
list.</p>
<h1>New Packages</h1>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-braces/">django-braces==0.1.3</a></h2>
<p>Want to use Django Class Based Views but unhappy with the missing
components like <code>LoginRequiredMixin</code>, <code>SelectRelatedMixin</code>, and even
<code>StaffuserRequiredMixin</code>? Not to worry, as this library will make Django
CBVs <strong>134% easier to use</strong>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-secure/">django-secure==0.1.2</a></h2>
<p>Django is rather secure, but there is a checklist of things that the
security experts want you to do. Save yourself forgetting something and
use this library to do all those little things.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-profiletools/">django-profiletools==0.1.3</a></h2>
<p>Have you ever used the django-debug-toolbar and noticed that you did
that same <code>request.user.get_profile()</code> call a dozen times? Ever want to
just call that once? This library, by yours truly, resolves the issue.
It loads the user's profile object once, and then passes it down the
request chain.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Existing Packages</h1>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.4.1">Django==1.4.1</a></h2>
<p>If you need sessions, forms, templates, and relational database models,
then I can argue you've got the ideal
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> project. Make certain you are running
the latest Django version (1.4.1). If you have any reason to stick to
the Django 1.3 series, I advise bumping it up to Django 1.3.2.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2">psycopg2==2.4.5</a></h2>
<p>This is the database connector to PostgreSQL, which is what you should
be using. Django is known for playing 'nicer' with PostgreSQL than
say... MySQL.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-debug-toolbar">django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4</a></h2>
<p>Because not using this tool is insane.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-extensions">django-extensions==0.8</a></h2>
<p>Because amongst other things this library gives you, I never want to
write my own <code>TimeStampedModel</code> ever again. :-)</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/South">South==0.7.6</a></h2>
<p>Django gives you the freedom to migrate data in the way you want. The
way I want to do it is via South.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-registration">django-registration==0.8.0</a></h2>
<p>The common go-to tool for non-Social registration.</p>
<p>This is a very solid tool, but you do have to make your own templates or
find someone's fork that has a copy of templates that match.</p>
<h2>django-social-auth== 0.7.4</h2>
<p>Want to authenticate via Twitter, Facebook, or GitHub? Then use this
very useful package.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-floppyforms">django-floppyforms==1.0</a></h2>
<p>An excellent tool for making your forms HTML5-ish out of the box. It
allows full control of form rendering in the templates.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms==1.1.4</a></h2>
<p>The child of my own django-uni-forms, this will let me create forms
using div-based controls super fast, and do layout customizations if I
need them.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-postgresify">django-heroku-postgresify==0.2</a></h2>
<p>This tool makes getting the PostGreSQL settings out of Heroku trivial.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-memcacheify">django-heroku-memcacheify==0.3</a></h2>
<p>This tool makes getting the memcache settings for Heroku trivial.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gunicorn">gunicorn==0.14.6</a></h2>
<p>All the cool kids who play in devops swear by Gunicorn.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Installing the above packages</h1>
<p>Never copy/paste these libraries directly into your projects. Do it the
right way: <strong>use proper Python dependency management</strong>.</p>
<p>Create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install them as proper
dependencies. The file should contain the following text:</p>
<pre><code>Django==1.4.1
South==0.7.5   
django-braces==0.1.3    
django-crispy-forms==1.1.4
django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4
django-extensions==0.8
django-floppyforms==1.0
django-social-auth==0.7.4
django-heroku-memcacheify==0.3
django-heroku-postgresify==0.2
django-profiletools==0.1.3
django-registration==0.8.0   
django-secure==0.1.2
gunicorn==0.14.2
psycopg2==2.4.5
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have that, you install them thus in your
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now that I have all this, it's time to code!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm terribly proud of what was accomplished last night: A car-sized
robot weighing a whopping 8,580 pounds (3,893 kg) was landed on Mars. It
is packed with scientific packages that will expand our knowledge of
Mars, and has the power to use them for at least 14 years.</p>
<p>Simply put, this is an incredible step forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_Science_Laboratory_Curiosity_rover.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Mars_Science_Laboratory_Curiosity_rover.jpg/800px-Mars_Science_Laboratory_Curiosity_rover.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p>As an American, I'm proud that our nation is capable of putting
together such amazing feats of engineering and science. People from a
diverse arrangement of backgrounds and origins came together to make
something incredible happen.</p>
<p>As a human being, I'm proud that we have yet again proven that we are
still capable of working together to make amazing things happen.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up in the 1970s, and someone who is proud to have
worked at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> for over 5 years, this is my
American dream.</p>
<h1>Going Forward</h1>
<p>Curiosity is about to do amazing things and will tell a story to us that
we'll never forget.</p>
<p>Alas, NASA is a terribly easy target for politicians. It's budget has
shrank to a small fraction of the it's early 1970s high, and it remains
a target to this day. While the politicians congratulate the JPL team on
one hand, they are also cutting the JPL budget in a short-sighted
attempt to make themselves look good. History will not be kind to such
politicians.</p>
<p>The answers to our questions and our problems will be found in the
heavens. Let's increase NASA funding and populate the world with
miracles of science.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/attaching-custom-exceptions-to-functions-and-classes"/>
        <updated>2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having too many custom exceptions on a project can be a pain, but a few
choices ones are really nice. The problem is that in complex libraries
having to import both functions and exceptions becomes a drag. To
mitigate having to remember to import custom exceptions, this is a handy
pattern you can use in a project and can be done on both functions and
classes.</p>
<h1>Attaching a custom exception to a function</h1>
<p>This works because <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> functions are first-class
objects. They can be passed around as things, and in this case, have
things assigned to them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># logic.py
class DoesNotCompute(Exception):
    """ Easy to understand naming conventions work best! """
    pass

def this_function(x):
    """ This function only works on numbers."""
    try:
        return x ** x
    except TypeError:
        raise DoesNotCompute

# Assign DoesNotCompute exception to this_function
this_function.DoesNotCompute = DoesNotCompute
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can import the function, and it won't just through
<code>DoesNotCompute</code> exceptions, it will also carry the function along with
the import:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from logic import this_function
>>> this_function(5)
3125
>>> this_function(4.5)
869.8739233809259
>>> this_function('will throw an error.')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#x3C;input>", line 1, in &#x3C;module>
  File "logic.py", line 10, in this_function
    raise DoesNotCompute
DoesNotCompute
</code></pre>
<p>Alright, that doesn't seem like much, but let's add in some exception
handling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> try:
...     this_function('is an example')
... except this_function.DoesNotCompute:
...     print('See what attaching custom exceptions to functions can do?')
...
...
See what attaching custom exceptions to functions can do?
</code></pre>
<h1>Attaching the custom exception to a class</h1>
<p>All we have to do is enhance our existing logic.py file by adding
<code>ThisClass</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># logic.py
class DoesNotCompute(Exception):
    """ Easy to understand naming conventions work best! """
    pass

# removed the function example for clarity

class ThisClass(object):
    # Since the DoesNotCompute exception exists, let's just assign it
    # as an attribute of ThisClass
    DoesNotCompute = DoesNotCompute

    def this_method(self, x):
        """ This method only works on numbers."""
        try:
            return x ** x
        except TypeError:
            raise DoesNotCompute
</code></pre>
<p>Now to demonstrate in the shell (Python REPL for the semantic purists):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from t import ThisClass
>>> this_class = ThisClass()
>>> this_class.this_method(3.3)
51.415729444066585
>>> this_class.this_method('Jack Diederich warned against custom exceptions')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#x3C;input>", line 1, in &#x3C;module>
  File "logic.py", line 24, in this_method
    raise DoesNotCompute
DoesNotCompute
>>> try:
...     this_class.this_method('I need to write a follow-up on my OAuth post')
... except ThisClass.DoesNotCompute:
...     print('Waiting to see how the OAuth stuff pans out')
...
...
Waiting to see how the OAuth stuff pans out
</code></pre>
<h1>Admonition: Don't go crazy</h1>
<p>Rather than use this trick all over the place, considering using it in a
few places to powerful effect. For example,
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> uses it only in a few places, and
publicly only on <code>MyModelClass.DoesNotExist</code> and
<code>MyModelClass.MultipleObjectsReturned</code>. By limiting Django's use of
this technique, Django libraries are that much easier to comprehend. In
this case, less complexity means more.</p>
<p>I say this because this pattern lends itself to creating custom
exceptions to the point of effectively replacing Python's stock
exceptions with your own. This makes for harder-to-maintain and
harder-to-learn projects.</p>
<p>Not that I've ever done that. Ahem.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-update-view-no-slug</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-update-view-no-slug"/>
        <updated>2012-07-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to use the Django Class Based View (CBV) UpdateView but
without a slug identifier in the URL. For example, instead of
<code>/profiles/pydanny/</code> I would go to <code>/my-crazy-profile/</code>. Also, I needed
to force authentication.</p>
<p>I've done this with Django functional views a few times times, but
today I did it in Django. This is what I did:</p>
<h2>1. Added django-braces to my project</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kennethlove">Kenneth Love</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tehjones">Chris
Jones</a>' awesome
<a href="https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/">django-braces</a> package has
some very handy mixins for working with Django CBVs. Kenneth and Chris
really understand CBVs, specifically on how to extend them, and have
provided a bunch of really useful utility methods in the django-braces
library. Yeah, I could figure this stuff out on my own, but since those
guys already did the hard work I might as well just lean on them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install django-braces==0.1.3
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = (
...
'braces',
...
)
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Wrote the view</h2>
<p>Assuming a very simple profile Model and Form (which they weren't - but
that's not what this post is about), this is how I implemented the
view:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># profiles/views.py
from django.views.generic import UpdateView

from braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin  # handles authentication

from profiles.forms import ProfileForm
from profiles.models import Profile

class ProfileUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):

    form_class = ProfileForm
    success_url = "/my-crazy-profile/"  # You should be using reverse here

    def get_object(self):
        return Profile.objects.get(user=self.request.user)
</code></pre>
<h2>3. Wrote the URLconf</h2>
<p>The URL pretty much wrote itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url

from profiles import views

urlpatterns = patterns("",
    url(regex=r'^my-crazy-profile/$',
        view=views.ProfileUpdateView.as_view(),
        name='profile_update'),
)
</code></pre>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>For a while, I've used django-braces for anything that involves CBVs. I
can't imagine working on projects using CBVs without them. In fact,
some of the mixins such as <code>LoginRequiredMixin</code> are things that I could
argue ought to be in core Django.</p>
<p>This pattern really nails the sweet spot of Django CBVs. Thanks to the
use of mixins and model forms, I get an amazing amount of stuff done in
a 5 line CBV.</p>

event</a>, over 60
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on
Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>,
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, and
<a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> developers arrived to work on a variety of
projects. We went from 10 AM to 10 PM, and there was much coding and
learning done by all. There was a very powerful vibe shared by nearly
everyone there, and it was great to see so many people from different
personal and open source backgrounds working together and having a great
time as a group.</p>
<h1>Filtering out distractions</h1>
<p>We made some changes to our proceedings for this event, entirely because
last time with 'distractions' that caused some issues. In a nutshell,
here is 50% of what we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>A clear statement in the event description and follow up emails that
this event was for developers and designers only.</li>
<li>Laptops were an absolute requirement for entry into the event.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also rolled in a couple other tricks I'm not going to write down. If
you see me in person, ask away. The results were near perfect, and we
won't hesitate to use these techniques again.</p>
<h1>Sponsors</h1>
<p>We let attendees know which sponsors were interested in potential new
hires, in this case, <a href="https://originatelabs.com">Originate</a> and
<a href="https://cars.com">Cars.com</a>. This sort of low-key technique helps us
land sponsors but doesn't annoy attendees. Speaking of sponsors, here
they are in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cars.com">Cars.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cartwheelweb.com">Cartwheel Web</a></li>
<li><a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a></li>
<li><a href="https://originatelabs.com">Originate</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Code/Projects worked on</h1>
<p>Next time I'm going to be a lot more careful about getting down the
details of what people did. Maybe a signup sheet or an online form?
Heck, sounds like a great quick project for next time!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> (see below for details)</li>
<li><a href="https://tglines.github.com/dynasaur/">Dynasaur</a> (Node.js/DynamoDB

tool that got 2 more tests)</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Lots more!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Django Sprints</h1>
<p>My conservative estimate is that we had 12 people working on Django or
Django related projects. That's at least 20% of attendees.
Unfortunately, because I'm not a Django core developer, I wasn't
reviewing commits; so I am not entirely sure what was being worked on. I
do know that I wasn't the only person to commit to core Django.</p>
<p>As for me, I continued my efforts started at DjangoCon Europe to
refactor the
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/">Class</a>
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/">Based</a>
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/mixins/">Views</a>
documentation. I got in two pull requests and finally managed to badly
teach myself how to use git rebase.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: I want to make it exceedingly clear that I'm not the only one
working the CBV doc refactor. I'm just one of the fold.</p>
<h1>Socializing</h1>
<p>During meals we tried to keep people's hands off the keyboard.
Specifically everyone got a chance to state their name, toolset they
were working with, and something interesting/embarrassing about
themselves. Three of the more memorable ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>An 8 year old attendee wrote his first 4 PHP programs!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sym_kat">sym_kat</a> is invited to speak at the
next London Perl Workshop.</li>
<li>Someone employed at SpaceX took Zed Shaw's
<a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">LPTHW</a> class taught by the man
himself at <a href="https://cartwheelweb.com">Cartwheel Web</a> HQ in 2011 got
himself moved from the C# to the Python team. Go open source!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>
<p>There were a few glitches, but nothing major. Most of those glitches
stem from us coming off two months of helping organize multiple events
while traveling literally around the world. I think things would have
been better if I had delegated more to the right people.</p>
<p>For the most part, there was this electrifying energy that had people
focused and working on what they wanted all day. Yet it wasn't all
heads-down-coding, their was some good coder-to-coder discussion and
fun. The result is at the end of the day people seemed refreshed and
empowered, wanting another day as soon as possible. We hope to be able
to catch this feeling at future events.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Corrected the details about the SpaceX guy.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a client who wanted their entire unlaunched public content site
quickly but temporarily blocked for a short period of time. He wanted a
universal password so he could send the site to reviewers, done quickly,
and nothing else. In a few days the site will launch, and even if
someone got through the authentication, nothing bad will happen except
for an early visitor. So we determined this was a job for a very simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic access
authentication</a>
implementation.</p>
<p>I asked around and <a href="https://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> gave me
this awesome snippet using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/barrel">barrel</a>
that I pasted right into the bottom of the
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> 1.4-style application's <code>wsgi.py</code>
file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Add to the bottom of your wsgi.py file
# Don't forget to add barrel to your requirements!
from barrel import cooper

REALM = "PRIVATE"
USERS = [('spam', 'eggs')]

application = cooper.basicauth(users=USERS, realm=REALM)(get_wsgi_application())
</code></pre>
<p>This took all of 5 minutes to implement and launch. The result is that
the first time you visit the site the login prompt appears. If you enter
'spam' and 'eggs' then you can see the site fine.</p>
<p>It worked and the customer was happy.</p>
<p>Will this block a concerted penetration attempt? Of course not. If the
site has/had critical or identifying information it would be implemented
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>. Implementing a Django
site with HTTPS is something I've done many times now, but this use
case was 'do it fast, easy, and make it temporary'.</p>
<p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> Pay attention to your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> As this is just adding in some WSGI middleware, this should
work without much modification in Flask, Pyramid, and other WSGI
compliant web frameworks.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/pycon-philippines-day-2"/>
        <updated>2012-07-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wonderful end to a wonderful event.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second day of <a href="https://ph.pycon.org">PyCon Philippines 2012</a> had a
really good turnout. My unofficial estimate is that we had about 90% of
the attendees from the first day attend (with the unfortunate exception
of most of the faculty and students of <a href="https://www.13hq.com/">Agoo Computer
College</a>).</p>
<p>The day started with...</p>
<h1>Lightning Talks</h1>
<p>Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm
kicking myself now. <strong>Really hard.</strong> I'll try and relate some of the
talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import this and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/that">that</a>, a parody
talk by Daniel Greenfeld (me). <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219244338029412352">Malcolm comment on
it.</a></li>
<li>Getting into space using weather balloons by Frank Pohlmann</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audreyr/ponystrap">Ponystrap</a> by <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey
Roy</a> (<a href="https://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=31">video from DjangoCon
Europe</a>)</li>
<li>Call for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog">Tagalog</a> and other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages">Philippine
languages</a>
translation of <a href="#django">Django</a> by Malcolm Tredinnick</li>
<li>The obligatory PyCon lighting talk on Vim by <a href="https://twitter.com/bry_bibat">Bryan
Bibat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openerp.com/">OpenERP</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/PliniusSecundus">Frank</a>
<a href="https://www.auberonsolutions.com/">Pohlmann</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-tan-pohlmann/4/a30/233">Ann
Tan-Pohlmann</a></li>
<li>A parody talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez">Sony Valdez</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then it was on to...</p>
<h1>Sprints and Tutorials</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves
beginners and then diving in. Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt">Malcolm Tredinnick</a> on
<a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219425413301157889">twitter</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Primary funding for the sprints came from the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation">Django Software
Foundation</a> and <a href="https://pythonsprints.com/">Python
Sprints</a>. That funding went towards food,
drinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee
turnout. Things sprinted on:</p>
<h2>Django</h2>
<p>Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could
fit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort,
with <a href="https://marconijr.com/">Marconi</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr">Moreto</a> helping out. It turned into
mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was
very heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their
own, and then work on projects using the framework.</p>
<p>I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django
core.</p>
<p>I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but
it was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get
moving in Django and other projects.</p>
<h2>Ansible</h2>
<p><a href="https://capsunlock.net">Rodney</a> <a href="https://github.com/cocoy">Quillo</a> led
the sprint on the <a href="https://ansible.github.com/">Ansible</a> tool of which he
is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They
seemed very productive and happy by day's end.</p>
<h2>pymongo</h2>
<p>A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out
an edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts,
but I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is
very common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of
geography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more
prevalent in the island nation.</p>
<h2>Other efforts</h2>
<p>Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going
on and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there
helping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the
moment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording
the efforts of so many.</p>
<h2>Tutorial Room</h2>
<p>About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is
where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the
conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the
room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez</li>
<li>Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat</li>
<li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/intro-to-python-11186202">21 Cool Things You Can Do With
Python</a>
by Daniel Greenfeld (me)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Food and drinks</h1>
<p>I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon
Philippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided
rather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good
professional catering service that most conferences rely on to the
dismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.</p>
<p>For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to
Pino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.</p>
<h1>Conference End</h1>
<p>The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words
about how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was
to see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired
he felt.</p>
<p>Then we cheered him.</p>
<p>After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends.
Which meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end.
I felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was
coming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that
I had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.</p>
<p>More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first day of the first PyCon Philippines!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ph.pycon.org">PyCon Philippines 2012</a> (PyCon PH) happened just
this past weekend at the <a href="https://www.upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines
Diliman</a> (UP Diliman) campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quezon_City">Quezon
City</a>, which is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila">Metro
Manila</a>.</p>
<p>I can assure you that PyCon PH was an wonderful, amazing, humbling
experience. I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you
why.</p>
<h1>Arrival</h1>
<p>Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us
to the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all
the while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his
lovely 21 month old daughter.</p>
<p>As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend,
Filipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing
keynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in
the Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at
PyCon PH.</p>
<p>Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were
greeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She
had over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of
registrants.</p>
<p>More on the herculean efforts of the organizers and volunteers of this
event in a forthcoming blog post.</p>
<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say
hello. There we met <a href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez">Sony Valdez</a>,
President of <a href="https://www.13hq.com/">Agoo Computer College</a>, and forty of
his faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and excitement,
belying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before in
order to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey,
Bryan, and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and
were determined in our speeches not to disappoint.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in
the middle of the afternoon. <strong>We didn't know they had to go until it
was time to leave</strong>. Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help
them come for the duration of the conference.</p>
<h1>PyCon Begins</h1>
<p>After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy
Valdez, started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH
chair thanked everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and
especially the attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about
shortly, and then it was time for the talks.</p>
<h2>Intro to Python<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/basic_python.html">^1</a></h2>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/titopao">Paolo Barazon</a></p>
<p>Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment
issues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I
spoke at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they
couldn't get the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job
under very trying conditions.</p>
<h2>Python Tricks you can't live without<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/python_tricks.html">^2</a></h2>
<p>By <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a></p>
<p>Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know
in Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and
virtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered
home the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this
was the best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)</p>
<h2>Django Quickstart<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/django_quickstart.html">^3</a></h2>
<p>By <a href="https://marconijr.com/">Marconi</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr">Moreto</a></p>
<p>Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good
introduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the
next day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a
simple TODO app, and you can see the working example at
<a href="https://quickstart.marconijr.com/">https://quickstart.marconijr.com/</a>.</p>
<h2>Game Programming with Python<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/game_programming.html">^4</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you afraid of math? Too bad! In this tutorial you will learn how
to math! Scary, isn't it?</p>
<p>-- Sony Valdez</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math
while wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the
best one I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and
extremely funny. And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep
(remember - he was on a bus with 40 of his students and faculty), he
broke many classic presenter rules:</p>
<p><strong>1. Live code demo</strong></p>
<p>He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes
part of the talk.</p>
<p><strong>2. Used notepad</strong></p>
<p>That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He
used notepad.</p>
<p><strong>3. Someone else's laptop</strong></p>
<p>He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a
keyboard you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with
while after a 5+ hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night
before.</p>
<p>I'm in awe.</p>
<h2>Functional Programming in Python<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/functional_programming.html">^5</a></h2>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt">Malcolm Tredinnick</a></p>
<p>Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of
his classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this
talk before, but this instance was clearly the best.</p>
<h2>Ansible<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/ansible.html">^6</a></h2>
<p>by <a href="https://capsunlock.net">Rodney</a> <a href="https://github.com/cocoy">Quillo</a></p>
<p>What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering?
Fortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on
<a href="https://ansible.github.com/">Ansible</a>, a pretty new Python based
deployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range of options,
and simplicity of use.</p>
<h2>I didn't know it's Python: Python Advocacy<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/python_advocacy.html">^7</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"PyCon: More fun in the Philippines"</p>
<p>-- Variant of the <a href="https://www.itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/">Philippines Department of Tourism
slogan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to
promote it's use, and why it's so awesome for... well.. lots of
things.</p>
<h2>Maps of Imaginary Lands<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/closing-keynote.html">^8</a></h2>
<p>Malcom came back to give us a talk on how to assemble the components
necessary to do a mashup of an imaginary place he cooked up.</p>
<h2>Closing Keynote: Design your open source project<a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/closing-keynote.html">^9</a></h2>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanveloso">Bryan</a>
<a href="https://avalonstar.com/">Veloso</a></p>
<p>Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech
instructing beginners on how to make your project used and loved by
developers. His slides were incredible, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/bryan/p/design-your-own-open-source-project">as you should see for
yourself</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ph.pycon.org">PyCon Philippines 2012</a>, set to occur on <strong>June
30</strong> and <strong>July 1</strong>, is the first Python programming conference held in
the Philippines. PyCon is a volunteer run effort that brings together
Python developers from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels into a
friendly, cooperative environment in order to educate, inspire, and work
together - building relationships that transcend the event and can turn
into lifelong friendships or even very impressive business alliances.</p>
<p>This event is possible due to the hard work and contributions of members
of the Manila Python users group, the support of the Python Software
Foundation, various members of the Python community, our gracious
sponsors, and many others.</p>
<p>I'll be there, along with Audrey Roy and
Django core developer <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt">Malcolm
Tredinnick</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>
<h1>What is Python?</h1>
<p><a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is an open source programming language used
for science, engineering, robotics, entertainment, web development, and
more. It is used by organizations such as Google, NASA, Instagram,
Pinterest, Mozilla, Walt Disney Animation Studios, WETA Digital, and
many more.</p>
<h1>Interested in attending?</h1>
<p>Then head to the <a href="https://ph.pycon.org/register.html">registration page</a>.
The early bird discount ends on June 15th, so buy your tickets now!</p>
<h1>Interested in sponsoring?</h1>
<p>Please go to the <a href="https://ph.pycon.org/sponsor.html">sponsorship page</a>.</p>
<p>Your sponsorship would go a long way towards making PyCon Philippines
2012 a memorable event. As this is an entirely volunteer-run event, 100%
of funds go toward actual event costs: food, drinks, chairs, tables,
signage, nametags, flyers, advertising, etc. Per custom with PyCons
around the world, the organizers receive no payment for their efforts,
and any funds left over will be either placed in a Philippine based
non-profit corporation or donated back to the Python Software
Foundation.</p>

<h1>What I did</h1>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>pip</code> I installed three packages into my Python environment.</li>
<li>Added those three packages into the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting.</li>
<li>Set the RECAPTCHA keys for my site.</li>
<li>Modified the <code>forms.py</code> file from yesterday to include the RECAPTCHA
field.</li>
<li>Reduced spam content.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What I could do</h1>
<ul>
<li>Pin the app versions for a particular release. This is what you
should be doing in normal development and in production, but for a
blog entry I'm avoiding it because release numbers become quickly
dated.</li>
<li>Rather than change the <code>ContactForm</code> from yesterday, I could have
extended it via inheritance.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On May 12th, 2012, over 50 <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>,
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, and
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> developers arrived to code on a variety of
projects. It was awesome! Tons of open source projects saw
contributions, and people across languages and frameworks worked
together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59834630@N07/7193954598/"><img src="image/7193954598_1b071cb5e4.jpg" alt="Hack Awayyy!!!"></a></p>
<h2>Event Background</h2>
<p>Less then two weeks before May 12, a bunch of us Los Angeles area Python
developers were hanging out and wishing we had a local sprint to attend
that was just about developers working on open source projects. It was
then that <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a> and I, along with an army
of hardworking volunteers, decided to stop wishing and make it happen on
May 12th.</p>
<p>We lined up a venue, contacted awesome sponsors
<a href="https://spire.io">Spire.io</a>, <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>,
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, <a href="https://cars.com">Cars.com</a>, and
<a href="https://academy.cartwheelweb.com">Cartwheel Academy</a>. As we did that,
we also invited people from the many Los Angeles programming communities
in Los Angeles to join us. The result of everyone's hard work? <strong>We
filled up all sixty spots in less than 96 hours!</strong></p>
<p>Some of the projects worked on included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salt Stack: <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">https://github.com/saltstack/salt</a></li>
<li>A node.js-powered streaming terminal, allowing for shared input at a
terminal among several participants.</li>
<li>A JavaScript powered astrolabe.</li>
<li>Settlers of Catan analytics in JavaScript.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>, a cross-platform
toolkit for creative coding in C++.</li>
<li>My own time at the sprint was spent with Audrey Roy and <a href="https://rdegges.com">Randall
Degges</a> on engineering cleanup and fixing bugs
on
<a href="https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison">OpenComparison</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More open source sprinting on July 15</h2>
<p>There's going to be another Los Angeles open source event on July 15 at
<a href="https://originate.com/">Originate</a>. Instead of less then two weeks to
plan, we have nearly two months - so it's going to be better!</p>
<p>RSVP here: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/64542582/">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/64542582/</a></p>
<p>If you want to sponsor or volunteer, email me at pydanny (at)
cartwheelweb.com or audreyr (at) cartwheelweb.com. We go out of our way
to ensure that sponsors and volunteers feel appreciated.</p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/10-reasons-djangocon-europe"/>
        <updated>2012-05-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You should go to <a href="https://djangocon.eu">DjangoCon Europe</a> in lovely
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Here are 10
reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Chocolate</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For
example, Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h1><strong>Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h1><strong>Cheese</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much
more. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master
craftsmen from the freshest ingredients.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h1><strong>Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a word, Jessica is <strong>incredible</strong>. She's a Twisted core developer,
PSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic Boston
Python User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker.
She's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in
the community and generally help other people.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h1><strong>Breakfast</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how
much better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's
homeland.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h1><strong>Web Site</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those
animations!</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h1><strong>Talks</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and
Andrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice
things up. And dare I say I'm giving a technical talk
with Audrey Roy? ;-)</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h1><strong>Mountains</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen
kilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h1><strong>Sprints</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be
Django core developers around! There will also be notable
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> developers like <a href="https://kennethreitz.com/">Kenneth
Reitz</a> and others around working hard on a lot
of different projects. It's going to intense and fun!</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h1><strong>Castles</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon
Europe will be near a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_Switzerland#Zurich">small horde of stone
fortifications</a>.
Which means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference,
we'll have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist
destinations. :-)</p>
<h1>What are you waiting for?</h1>
<p>DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have
been selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!</p>
<h1>It's all about me</h1>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all
our European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in
Zurich!</p>

There's just been one problem: Myself and others have had a lot of
trouble reading the code snippets.</p>
<p>I didn't have time to cook up a full Pelican theme, so instead I just
hacked the local CSS files. The problem with this hack is that every
time I regenerate the blog I have to copy the right CSS files into

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/choosing-api-framework-for-django</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/choosing-api-framework-for-django"/>
        <updated>2012-05-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First off, out of the box, <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> lets you
construct API responses with a little work. All you need to do is
something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Copied from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/class-based-views/#more-than-just-html
from django import http
from django.utils import simplejson as json

class JSONResponseMixin(object):
    def render_to_response(self, context):
        "Returns a JSON response containing 'context' as payload"
        return self.get_json_response(self.convert_context_to_json(context))

    def get_json_response(self, content, **httpresponse_kwargs):
        "Construct an `HttpResponse` object."
        return http.HttpResponse(content,
                                 content_type='application/json',
                                 **httpresponse_kwargs)

    def convert_context_to_json(self, context):
        "Convert the context dictionary into a JSON object"
        # Note: This is *EXTREMELY* naive; in reality, you'll need
        # to do much more complex handling to ensure that arbitrary
        # objects -- such as Django model instances or querysets
        # -- can be serialized as JSON.
        return json.dumps(context)
</code></pre>
<p>Once you get that mixin, use it in your views like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># modified from djangoproject.com sample code
from django.utils import simplejson as json

class JSONDetailView(JSONResponseMixin, MyCustomUserView):
    def convert_context_to_json(self, context):

        context['objects'] = User.objects.values('first_name','last_name','is_active')
        return json.dumps(context)
</code></pre>
<p>This works pretty well in a number of simple cases, but doing things
like pagination, posting of data, metadata, API discovery, and other
important things ends up being a bit more work. This is where the
resource oriented API frameworks come in.</p>
<h1>What makes a decent API Framework?</h1>
<p>These features:</p>
<ul>
<li>pagination</li>
<li>posting of data with validation</li>
<li>Publishing of metadata along with querysets</li>
<li>API discovery</li>
<li>proper HTTP response handling</li>
<li>caching</li>
<li>serialization</li>
<li>throttling</li>
<li>permissions</li>
<li>authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper API frameworks also need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really good test coverage of their code</li>
<li>Decent performance</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>An active community to advance and support the framework</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take these factors, at this time there are only two API
frameworks worth using, <a href="#django-tastypie">django-tastypie</a> and
<a href="#django-rest-framework">django-rest-framework</a>.</p>
<h1>Which one is better? django-tastypie or django-rest-framework?</h1>
<p>I say they are equal.</p>
<p>You simply can't go wrong with either one. The authors and communities
behind both of them are active, the code is solid and tested. And here
are my specific thoughts about both of them:</p>
<h1>django-tastypie</h1>
<p>Using django-tastypie is like playing with pure Python while using the
Django ORM. I find it very comfortable. Seems really fast too. The
documentation is incredible, and I rarely have any problems figuring
anything out. It also supports OAuth 1.0a out of the box, which is
mighty awesome these days.</p>
<p>In fact, I wrote a custom OAuth2 handler for django-tastypie for
consumer.io that I'm working to extract for
publication.</p>
<h1>django-rest-framework</h1>
<p>As it's based off Django 1.3 style Class Based Views (CBVs), it has a
very familiar pattern. Actually, because of the quality of the
documentation, I really prefer using django-rest-framework CBVs more
than using Django's actual CBVs.</p>
<p>Maybe I should make an HTML renderer for django-rest-framework? :-)</p>
<h1>But what about django-piston?</h1>
<p><strong>Don't use django-piston</strong>.</p>
<p>I don't want to say anything negative, but let's face it:
<strong>django-piston is dead</strong>. Besides a critical security release last
year, nothing has been done for it in about 3 years. The documentation
is weak, the code mostly untested, and the original author left. He has
gone on to do some amazing things. Django-piston was amazing in its
time, but its time has passed and so should you.</p>
<p>The only reason for using django-piston for years has been that it
supported OAuth, but django-tastypie now addresses that use case. I've
used django-tastypie's basic OAuth class and rolled custom
Authentication modules to support some extra OAuth flavors and found it
wonderful.</p>
<p>Use django-tastypie or django-rest-framework instead. You'll be much,
much happier for it.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-reqs</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-reqs"/>
        <updated>2012-05-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm starting a new project. I'm working as fast as I can and
hope to launch on Friday. What are my package dependencies?</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.4">Django==1.4</a></h1>
<p>Unlike my last quick project which was <a href="https://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>,
this effort really falls into <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>'s
sweet spot. I need sessions, forms, templates, and models to do things
in an ideal Django pattern.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2">psycopg2==2.4.5</a></h1>
<p>I need transactions and hard-type validation in the database, which
means PostgreSQL. If I didn't need transactions or the hard-type
validation I would consider MongoDB instead.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-debug-toolbar">django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4</a></h1>
<p>Because not using this tool is insane.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-extensions">django-extensions==0.8</a></h1>
<p>Because amongst other things this library gives you, I never want to
write my own <code>TimeStampedModel</code> ever again. :-)</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/South">South==0.7.5</a></h1>
<p>Django gives you the freedom to migrate data in the way you want. The
way I want to do it is via South.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-registration">django-registration==0.8.0</a></h1>
<p>Normally
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-social-auth">django-social-auth</a> is
my go-to tool for registration, but in this case I need simple
username/password registration. This is a very solid tool, but you do
have to make your own templates or find someone's fork that has a copy
of templates that match.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013/12/17</strong>: django-registration is no longer maintained and
doesn't entirely work with modern Django's new user model system. Use
<a href="https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth">django-allauth</a> instead.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-floppyforms">django-floppyforms==0.4.7</a></h1>
<p>An excellent tool for making your forms HTML5-ish out of the box.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms==1.1.3</a></h1>
<p>The child of my own django-uni-forms, this will let me create forms
using div-based controls super fast, and do layout customizations if I
need them.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-postgresify">django-heroku-postgresify==0.2</a></h1>
<p>This tool makes getting the PostGreSQL settings out of Heroku trivial.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-memcacheify">django-heroku-memcacheify==0.1</a></h1>
<p>This tool makes getting the memcache settings for Heroku trivial.</p>
<h1><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gunicorn">gunicorn==0.14.2</a></h1>
<p>All the cool kids who play in devops swear by Gunicorn. I use it because
Heroku seems to recommend it for Django deployments.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Installing the above packages</h1>
<p>Never copy/paste these libraries directly into your projects. If you do
that, you'll end up hating yourself later as your local instances
become unmaintained forks of the real project. Also, unless you are
really careful in your copy/pasting, you'll be in violation of various
open source licenses. Odds are the FOSS police aren't going to find
you, but I can assure you that when you bring in one of the authors of
these packages to help you fix a problem he/she is going to be mighty
annoyed at the lack of attribution.</p>
<p>Do it the right way: do proper Python dependency management.</p>
<p>Create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install them as proper
dependencies. The file should contain the following text:</p>
<pre><code>Django==1.4
South==0.7.5
django-crispy-forms==1.1.3
django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4
django-extensions==0.8
django-floppyforms==0.4.7
django-heroku-memcacheify==0.1
django-heroku-postgresify==0.2
django-registration==0.8.0
gunicorn==0.14.2
psycopg2==2.4.5
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have that, you install them thus in your
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now that I have all this, it's time to code!</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/los-angeles-sprint</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/los-angeles-sprint"/>
        <updated>2012-05-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/7132778527/"><img src="/images/7132778527_6e3b49b313_o.png" alt="Los Angeles Open Source Sprint"></a></p>
<p>This is a day long coding event in Los Angeles for Open Source
developers of all languages and skill levels to come and code like
fiends. They'll be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or
nice people like me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and
more!</p>
<p>RSVP at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/</a> before it
fills up! It's free.</p>
<p>I'll be there to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles
technical community!</li>
<li>Code like a fiend. I want to work on django-mongonaut and could use
some GraphViz and JavaScript help.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>
<h1>Where and when?</h1>
<p>Where:</p>
<pre><code>Spire.io
7257 Beverly Blvd #210
Los Angeles, CA 90036
</code></pre>
<p>When:</p>
<pre><code>May 12, 2012
10 AM to 10 PM
</code></pre>
<h1>Is this like a Hackathon?</h1>
<p>Yup. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints</a></p>
<h1>Will there be Wifi?</h1>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h1>I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?</h1>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p><strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place. Instead,
you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In
fact, here's a good <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/">bi-weekly hack night / study
group</a> for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great way to
learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced
developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are
called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for
beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at
events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other
things that have made me a better coder.</p>
<h1>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</h1>
<p>Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join
and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. There
isn't a list up yet, but I'm hoping by Saturday there will be one.</p>
<h1>What if I want to come and recruit people?</h1>
<p><strong>Absolutely not</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not a job fair and we don't want unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we'll happily mention
you on the
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/">meetup.com</a>
description.</p>
<h1>Are there going to be any presentations or lightning talks?</h1>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is a sprint, not a conference or demonstration. We'll try and
limit announcements and interruptions as much as possible, the only
exception being for letting you know food has arrived.</p>
<h1>What should I bring?</h1>
<p>Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,
the venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to
bring a power strip labeled with your name.</p>
<h1>I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?</h1>
<p>The event costs you nothing and you RSVP at
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/</a>.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/djangocon-europe</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/djangocon-europe"/>
        <updated>2012-04-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year in June, the European edition of
<a href="https://djangocon.eu">DjangoCon</a> is going to be held in lovely
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. It is my great
fortune and delight to announce that <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.cm/">Audrey</a> and
I will be attending. Hooray!</p>
<p>Needless to say, we're extremely excited. My <a href="https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2007">trip to Europe in
2007</a> was
an amazingly fun and educational experience, and I can't wait to share
a similar experience with Audrey. We can't wait to see all our old
European friends, make new ones, and be dazzled by what Europe has to
offer.</p>
<p>Also, let's face it, the conference is going to be <strong>incredible</strong>.
They've lined up some awesome venues, the food
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette">cheese</a>, chocolate,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli">muesli</a>, etc) in Switzerland is
world-renowned, the website looks fantastic, and they've got Jacob
Kaplan-Moss to keynote. It looks so good I'm surprised there are any
<a href="https://2012.djangocon.eu/sponsors/">sponsor slots left</a>!</p>
<h1>Talks</h1>
<p>While attending the conference, we submitted and hope to give a
presentation on the positives (speed, flexibility, community, etc) and
negatives (a few) of using <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> as a
<a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a> datastore. I'm also considering
giving a second talk. Some ideas for that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen of Django</li>
<li>Django isn't for beginners (A Tredennick inspired talk explaining
why teaching beginning developers Django isn't a good idea)</li>
<li>Advanced Django Template Usage</li>
<li>Advanced Django Models Usage (An intimidating talk to put together)</li>
<li>Django Packages Thunderdome II</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I'm going to poke any prospective conference goers to
submit their own talks. I love attending conference talks and at PyCon
US this year I barely got to see any. Show me what you got!</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing a new python based blog engine]]></title>
        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/choosing-a-new-blog-engine</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/choosing-a-new-blog-engine"/>
        <updated>2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Why a new blog engine?</h1>
<p>On my <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/">old blog</a>, I had been having
issues with Blogger for some time. The WYSIWYG text editor was annoying
in that it produced wonky HTML, so I had to hand craft the posts. Which
meant I often wrote the HTML formatted copy in a text editor and then
copy/pasted it into the browser. A few times this blew up and I really
wished I had version controlled back ups. Adding code examples was
problematic, even with a stylesheet helpfully provided by Google.
Finally, some of the changes to the blog engine itself were beginning to
worry me, so I started looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>After my fiancee, <a href="https://www.aroygreenfeld.com/">Audrey Roy</a>, converted her blog to
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll</a> at it's new location of
aroygreenfeld.com (now at <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">audrey.roygreenfeld.com</a>), the static file hosting seemed
so awesome I was impressed enough to <a href="/tried-out-jekyll.html">give Jekyll a
try</a>. Why did Jekyll and
static file hosting interest me so much?</p>
<h2>I don't want to maintain my own server</h2>
<p>A couple times I rolled out a blog on a site I stood up, but didn't
really feel like maintaining a site. I want someone else to do it. When
I write, I want someone else to worry about the details. I want to focus
on writing and nothing else.</p>
<p>Well... almost nothing else. You'll understand shortly.</p>
<h2>I want to be able to write without connection</h2>
<p>With blogger, I needed an internet connection to get my blog posts to
format correctly. With Jekyll and other static file systems, I can just
type away.</p>
<h2>I want to publish via git</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org">https://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org</a> has really exploded in my own
usage and continued because it uses the same patterns I use in software
development. I'm used to the pattern of using Git to push up content,
so why use naked HTML? Sure, there are RST-to-HTML processors that I
could use to generate that HTML, but they always require some amount of
manual correction. Jekyll, and it's alternatives, let me just write.</p>
<h1>Jekyll wasn't for me</h1>
<p>I found Jekyll to be good and much more fun than Blogger, but not good
enough. To sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>I prefer RestructuredText over Markdown.</li>
<li>I don't know enough Ruby to easily customize things. I don't feel
like diving into Ruby just to learn how to make modifications.</li>
<li>The template engine was like Smarty/Django/Jinja2, but not as much
fun. Debugging errors was very problematic. Which was a problem when
I started to play with modifying the theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the second and third bullets, you might wonder why I would care about
the underlying engine if all I wanted to do was write. Well, I'm well
aware of the fact that I change opinions now and then. :-)</p>
<p>It was after trying out Jekyll that I started looking for
<a href="https://python.org">Python</a> based static file blog systems. The choices
that seemed appropriate were:</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/">blogofile</a></h1>
<p>This is probably the most mature, most common Python static file
generator around. It looks really awesome, and everyone who uses it
swears by it. Alas, it's powered by
<a href="https://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako</a> templates, which is... um...
<a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/12/stupid-template-languages.html">not my
friend</a>
(apologies to <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/12/04/in-response-to-stupid-template-languages/">Mike
Bayer</a>).
What I really wanted was something with templates powered by
<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com">Jinja2</a>.</p>
<h1><a href="https://hyde.github.com/">hyde</a></h1>
<p>Hyde claims to have started as Jekyll's evil Python twin. On the
surface it looks awesome. Where it fails is documentation. There are
lots of wonderful features that appear to exist, but follow the links to
those features and you find yourself on placeholder pages.</p>
<p>In theory, I could have just looked at the hyde code and figured out
stuff myself. Maybe even document out the holes.</p>
<p>In practice, all I want to do is write blog posts. It's one thing to
customize things to suit your needs, it's another thing to make things
work. Or document a tool. Color me lazy if you will, but when it comes
to blogging, that's just how I am.</p>
<p>I think in the near future, once fully documented, Hyde is going to be
AWESOME. For now? Well, I wanted another option.</p>
<h1><a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/">pelican</a></h1>
<p>I was immediately hooked. Python powered engine with Jinja2 templates
with <strong>complete documentation</strong>. In fact, every time I asked the author
for help, he resignedly pointed me at the documentation. How cool is
that?</p>
<p>At some point I'll use the <code>CSS</code> setting to change the color of
<code>pygments</code> to something with white background and black text. For now
I'm happy as things are now.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/calendar-about-nothing</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/calendar-about-nothing"/>
        <updated>2012-03-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On October 16th, 2011, which was one hundred and sixty-four days before
I published this post, I resolved to get myself onto the Longest Streak
list of Calendar About Nothing. Today, with this blog post, I've managed to do just that - get on the
Longest Streaks.</p>
<p>Calendar About Nothing tracks your open project commits on
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. It tallies your total number of days,
records your longest streak, and lets you compare yourself against other
committers. The idea comes from an
<a href="https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret?tag=softwaremotivation">article</a>
where Jerry Seinfeld says his secret to productivity is to get something
done every day, because if you skip one day then skipping another day is
easier.</p>
<h1>I feel a great sense of accomplishment.</h1>
<p>The majority of those days I would like to think I did real commits. I
pledged to myself to do more than just white space tweaks or write a
script to do the work for me. I wanted to accomplish things and make a
difference. I started projects, wrote code, cleaned up old code, added
tests, documented a lot, and moved my blog here. It's been an awesome
time, and keeping my fingers constantly in projects has been eye
opening.</p>
<h1>I feel a great sense of relief.</h1>
<p>I've really enjoyed this but there were days it was hard to get to the
internet or days I was busy on other things. I discovered early on my
phone was not a good interface with Github's text editor. Some days I
had no desire to code or lacked the creativity to write. Then I
remembered that my ability to work openly on Github is a gift, and I
should just do it. Now I can relax a bit and if I miss a day, it's not
such a big deal. I've made it to the Longest Streak list!</p>
<h1>Going for a longer streak</h1>
<p>We'll see what happens now. I just feel happy that I've captured the
moment and made my mark on the board. I invite you to do the same.</p>

features of <a href="https://opencomparison.org">Open Comparison</a>, Yelp, Consumer
Reports, and Pinterest. We've worked day and night to make it better,
with countless members of the Python community using the site and giving
us invaluable feedback.</p>
<p>All of that brings us to <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon</a>. We're not
just here as attendees and participants, but also to promote our
startup. It used to be the cool thing to launch your startup at SXSW,
but times have changed. Now it's the cool thing to launch at PyCon!</p>
<p>Like Twilio, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, we've got an
<a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com">API</a> we want developers to use. And as
an upcoming startup, we've got to really be creative in how we gain
your attention, so here is what we're doing for PyCon 2012:</p>
<h2>1. Demos at our <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon Startup Row</a> booth.</h2>
<p>Thanks PyCon!</p>
<p>We've got a booth on Saturday. We've got banners and bright red track
jackets. We're giving out handy API reference cards, as well as 10
different <a href="https://consumernotebook.com/lists/audreyr/list-of-oreo-cookie-flavors/">flavors of Oreo
cookies</a>
(see our site for a complete list of every Oreo cookie flavor, by the
way).</p>
<p>So stop on by, sign up for the BETA, have a cookie, and talk to us about
our API. For that matter, feel free to talk to me or Audrey about the
API any time you see us. We're wearing bright red jackets with '<strong>Ask
me about our API</strong>' on our back.</p>
<p>Speaking of the API, the next item on our plan is...</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. A big kickoff API contest.</h2>
<p>We've put together the Consumer Notebook
<a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com">API</a>, which lets you get product list
and comparison data out of our site via a simple REST interface.</p>
<p>We're kicking off our PyCon 2012 API launch with an <a href="https://developers.consumernotebook.com/contest.html">API
contest</a>.</p>
<p>You have from now until April 22 to find new and exciting ways to use
our <a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com">API</a>. If you win we'll give you a
Kindle Fire or equivalent gift certificate valid in your nation of
origin.</p>

<h2>3. We're hosting the Saturday night <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon Capoeira Open Space</a></h2>
<p>Want to see some awesome Capoeira moves? Want to learn some of the
basics? Want to just have fun?</p>
<p>We've hired professional Hollywood stuntman and Capoeira instructor to
the stars, <a href="https://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7">Contra Mestre Xingu</a>,
to come up from Los Angeles to lead this event. In addition to appearing
in movies, videos, and commercials, he's got first hand experience with
snakes. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capoeira saved my life. What? How? Well it was a sunny afternoon, I
was shooting a film in the Hollywood hills off Coldwater Canyon at a
house. I was running back to set from the bathroom and out of nowhere
a rattlesnake jumped up from the ground and tried to bite me. I
quickly jumped out of the way and did a fast negative
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#Rol.C3.AA">rolé</a>
away from the snake. Then I called the other people on set and we
caught it. I really didn't think much of it afterwards until after
the shoot. My friend told me the rattlesnake was a young one and I'm
lucky I didn't get bitten. When a younger rattler bites you, it
usually unloads all of it's venom in you because it cannot control
the amount it releases.</p>
<p>-- Contra Mestre Xingu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 30 people have signed up up for this event, including Python core
developers.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<pre><code>When: Saturday, 8pm - 10pm
What to bring: Camera!
What to bring if you are participating: Workout clothes, water bottle
</code></pre>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/sorry-state-python-oauth-providers</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/sorry-state-python-oauth-providers"/>
        <updated>2012-03-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of those challenging posts to write. The people whose
projects I'm going to describe have put in a lot of dedicated, hard
work to overcome a challenging subject. Writing an OAuth consumer is a
hard problem and writing an OAuth provider is an even harder problem.
The efforts put in by the authors of these projects has been nothing
short of incredible. The problem, however, is that the existing projects
are not usable as-is, and need the support of the community in order to
improve.</p>
<p>The terrible thing is that this is a solved problem within our
community. Python based projects are successfully implementing OAuth
providers, and often using internally hacked versions of the efforts
I'm about to describe. However, they aren't giving this back to the
community. It might be that they want to protect their competitive edge,
but I'm going to be nice and say that it's because their too busy to
find time to send pull requests back.</p>
<p>In any case, let me present our use case. For <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer
Notebook</a> we want an
<a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com">API</a>. We want to be able to track
usernames, passwords, and the application using our
<a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com">API</a> - which is the OAuth use case.
Much as BasicAuth or DigestAuth is the easier way to go in terms of
implementation, OAuth was designed for our use case: allowing
third-party developers to build apps using our API without having to
store credentials. In fact, it's a critical security issue: Twitter
dealt with malicious "Twitter apps" stealing usernames and passwords
before they switched to OAuth. As an API provider, being an OAuth
provider might be more challenging, but it's the responsible thing to
do.</p>
<h1>Existing OAuth Providers</h1>
<p>Time to get into the meat of the issue. Let's look at the current
implementations of OAuth providing within the Python community. Again, I
wish I didn't have to be negative, but I'm up against the wall:</p>
<h2>OAuth2app (Django)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hiidef/OAuth2app">https://github.com/hiidef/OAuth2app</a></p>
<p>OAuth version: 2.0</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange URL construction that might be a security hole.</li>
<li>Bitwise operators in the logic making it harder to debug. Security
is hard. Don't complicate your security code because your mistakes
will cost.</li>
<li>Uncommented code. Security is hard. Comment your code.</li>
<li>Documentation outdated and insufficient.</li>
<li>Doesn't work without serious hacking and adding of undocumented
parameters. Which means I have to worry if I'm breaking anything.</li>
<li>We managed to get it working with GET requests. Then we realized
that we were using GET requests, which seems like a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>django-piston (Django)</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston">https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston</a></p>
<p>OAuth version: 1.0</p>
<ul>
<li>Stalled project.</li>
<li>Documentation insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2>django-oauth-plus (Django)</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.larlet.fr/django-oauth-plus">https://code.larlet.fr/django-oauth-plus</a></p>
<p>OAuth version: 1.0a</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial doesn't work.</li>
<li>Documentation insufficient.</li>
<li>Doesn't work without serious hacking. Which means I have to worry
if I'm breaking anything.</li>
<li>We could not get it to work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>lastuser (Flask)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser</a></p>
<p>OAuth version: 2.0</p>
<ul>
<li>No documentation</li>
<li>No tests to serve as documentation</li>
<li>Lack of documentation means I'm not sure if it is actually a OAuth
provider.</li>
</ul>
<h2>python-oauth2 (Python)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dgouldin/python-OAuth2">https://github.com/dgouldin/python-OAuth2</a> (best example)</p>
<p>OAuth version: 1.0</p>
<ul>
<li>Called 'OAuth2' but only works with OAuth 1? Really? <strong>WTF?</strong> This
needs to fixed.</li>
<li>Documentation insufficient.</li>
<li>Provides only a skeleton of a provider. Not a turnkey solution.</li>
<li>Doesn't work as a provider without serious hacking. Which means I
have to worry if I'm breaking anything.</li>
<li>Many, many forks of the project, with various blog posts advising
people to use various particular forks rather than the main one.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How about a solution?</h1>
<p>Alright, I've ranted and laid out out a bunch of bullets identifying a
problem. Time to try and fix the problem.</p>
<p>For starters, a production-usable OAuth provider should meet certain
standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Near turnkey solution</li>
<li>Working code (duplicates above bullet but I'm making a point)</li>
<li>Working tutorials</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Commented code</li>
<li>Linted code</li>
<li>Test coverage > 80%</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my specification. If your project for any Python framework
matches it, I'll list it on a forthcoming website that also covers
Python based OAuth consumers.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, Idan Gazit has been working on something to help
address the problem, specifically <a href="https://github.com/idan/oauthlib">https://github.com/idan/oauthlib</a>. It
also is intended to cover the Python OAuth consumption issue I didn't
cover in this article. It and related efforts need a lot of work, so...</p>
<p>The PyCon US 2012 sprints start on March 12. I think as a community, we
Pythonistas should band together and make things right. I think we'll
have the brainpower and enough eyes on the problem to make serious
headway on the issue, either by fixing existing solutions or creating
new ones. Right now I've got interest from people to join in and help,
including Idan Gazit, Audrey Roy, George Hickman, and others.</p>
<p>We're willing to put in the time to make OAuth in Python better, how
about you?</p>
<p>Join us at the PyCon US sprints either in person or on-line. <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/sprints/projects/">Details of
the sprint are near the bottom of this PyCon Sprint
page</a>.</p>

        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/you-should-heroku</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/you-should-heroku"/>
        <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In mid-November me and my fiancee, <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey Roy</a>
began our startup. We had been frustrated with trying to do on-line
product research and came up with an idea to take the lessons learned
from <a href="https://djangopackages.com">Django Packages</a> / <a href="https://opencomparison.org">Open
Comparison</a> and apply them to a commercial
effort. The result has been <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer
Notebook</a>, and it's been a steadily
growing success.</p>
<p>We've been bootstrapping the project. That means supporting it with
consulting and grinding away on it during our free time. That means
12-16 hour days of Python, Django, and Javascript coding, marketing,
system administration, graphic design, communicating with users and
vendors, and a thousand other tasks. Since we've had to explore new
techniques for making things work on the backend and front end, that
means we've needed to have a robust system that is trivial to deploy
and certain to never go down. Which, of course, requires serious sys
admin skills.</p>
<h1>The Big Problem</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I hate system administration work.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sys admin is boring. I find it tedious and dull. Devops doesn't make it
easier/faster, it just makes it possible to do it at a large scale.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, my fiancee likes the sys admin side of things.
However, she's got serious programming skills in Python/Javascript,
understands CSS, is an excellent illustrator, and has good business
skills to boot. Which means <strong>I needed Audrey not to be doing sys
admin</strong>.</p>
<h1>Solution: Platform as a Service</h1>
<p>Platform as a Service, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaaS">PaaS</a>, is
where someone else does the majority of work involved in system
administration. There are now <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Heroku-equivalent-for-Django-applications-Edit-Question-not-relevant-anymore-as-Heroku-now-supports-Django">dozens of companies edging into the
Python capable PaaS
space</a>.
We've been leery of using any of them but finally settled on
<a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> after a long period of evaluation.</p>
<h1>Why Heroku?</h1>
<p>We choose Heroku for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We competed in a Los Angeles area Hacking contest with <a href="https://rdegges.com/">Randall
Degges</a>. He was responsible for the sys admin
and went with Heroku. He got it up and it was out of the way for the
competition. He spent his time coding, adding features, and fixing
templates instead of tweaking knobs on something in the cloud. We
saw other people not deliver products at the contest because of this
issue.</li>
<li>Heroku doesn't lock you in. If I wanted to, I could take all the
pieces out in about 10 minutes, then go old school and host it
myself on my own closet server.</li>
<li>Heroku has very good
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres">PostgreSQL</a>
support. Our web framework is <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
which has an ORM that works best with PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Heroku has staff. At least seventy of them. Odds are they would have
people around 24/7 to deal with issues.</li>
<li>The add-on system means they've got many other people adding great
new features. Want <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/mongolab">MongoDB</a>? No
problem! How about something to <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/pandastream">handle
video</a>? You got it!</li>
<li>Heroku scales up trivially. If we get an upswell of users, I just
type <code>heroku ps:scale web=50</code> and I've got 50 web server things
handling the load.</li>
<li>When I think of Heroku I think of Puffer Fish. Which is awesome
because Puffer Fish are awesome.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/saspotato/5776592544/"><img src="/images/5776592544_fb15a2902a_m.jpg" alt="Puffer fish"></a></p>

<h2>Things that we really liked about using Heroku</h2>
<p>As we progressed down the journey of building our site, we discovered
even more nice features about Heroku. Here are some of the things that
really make me smile:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases">Releases</a> and
especially
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases#rollback">rollbacks</a>
means we deploy with a lot more confidence.</li>
<li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging">Logging</a> and other
diagnostic add-ons like <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/sentry">Sentry</a>
and <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic">New Relic</a> means we know
what's going on.</li>
<li>During one huge data migration effort I scaled up the workers so a 6
hour task became a 5 minute task. Cost was less then 10 cents for
workers instead of me losing hours of labor.</li>
<li>In case we go viral, we don't have to worry about load balancers
and all that high performance stuff.</li>
</ol>
<h1>What does that mean?</h1>
<p>It means I'm doing the deployments. I'm the sys admin. And I'm happy
with my role because it takes minutes out of my day. Me and Audrey team
up on everything else and the results so far have been great. If you've
ever worked with me, the fact that <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer
Notebook</a> is administered and deployed by
me is going to be a shock.</p>
<p>We've been able to really focus on development of the project. And when
I mean development, I mean a lot of things. I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Django</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Data Modeling</li>
<li><a href="https://api.consumernotebook.com/">Documenting the API</a></li>
<li>Marketing: <a href="https://insidertips.consumernotebook.com/">blogging on Consumer
Notebook</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/consumernotebk">Tweeting</a>, and working with
other groups</li>
<li>Trying out <a href="https://github.com/consumernotebook/tickets/issues">public
tickets</a></li>
<li>Iterating through the user experience by communicating to users</li>
<li>All the boring legal and business stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>What you don't see is anything about sys admin issues. That's because
what could have been a huge sink in time and resources is pretty much
gone. We deploy staging servers with a bit of code I copy/pasted from a
bash history into a Fabric script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from fabric.api import local

commands = """
heroku create --stack cedar
heroku addons:add memcache
heroku config:add S3_KEY=HAHAHAHAHAHA S3_SECRET=NOTGIVINGITOUT
heroku addons:add redistogo
heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter
heroku addons:add mongolab:starter
heroku addons:add sentry:test
heroku addons:add pgbackups
heroku addons:add custom_domains:basic
heroku addons:add zerigo_dns:basic
heroku domains:add staging.consumernotebook.com
heroku addons:add ssl:piggyback
git push heroku master
heroku scale web=1
heroku addons:add heroku-PostgreSQL:ronin
heroku pg:wait
"""

def build_staging():
    for command in commands.strip().split('\n'):
        local(command)
</code></pre>
<p>How awesome is that?</p>
<h1>How much does Heroku really cost?</h1>
<p>You can do Heroku for free. A lot of people do. More power to them.</p>
<p>But let's face it, beyond a certain point, every PaaS, including
Heroku, is going to be more expensive then getting your own EC2,
Rackspace, Dreamhost, or Linode hosted server. For a fraction of the
cost, you can provision a server, install all the bits, configure the
database, http server, load balancers, and even write Chef/Puppet/Fabric
scripts so you can do it repeatedly at scale. Cheap!</p>
<p>So why pay more for Heroku? Why not just do it ourselves? For example,
right now we're on dedicated PostgreSQL hosting which Heroku charges us
$200/month. That's a lot, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now we're seeing a 50% increase in visits every day. So if we ran
our own servers, Chef/Puppet/Fabric or not, odds are we would be
spending at least 10 hours a month doing server work. And I can assure
you that when we consult that we make more than $20/hour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>$200 &#x3C; 10 hours of us doing consulting work to bootstrap the
project.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until you hit a certain point, these days the real cost of servers is
labor. If you're a developer or small effort, and you think going with
a cheap hosting provider is the way to go, think again. Think about the
hours you're losing monkeying around with servers and databases instead
of getting code done.</p>
<p>Heroku saves us money.</p>
<h1>The Takeaway</h1>
<p>One of the problems Django and other Python web frameworks has had is
the difficulty of deployment. I can't tell you how many projects I
didn't do because of the thought of handling the sys admin side of
things. Let's face it, one of the great ongoing successes for PHP is
that deploying the majority of sites is trivial.</p>
<p>With the rise of devops we've seen a lot of developers across languages
and frameworks dive into <strong>Chef</strong> and <strong>Puppet</strong>. It's been sadly
amusing watching people muck around with these great tools to make the
deployment of 1-2 servers 'easier', when the real benefit of those
tools has been to do things at scale. Things like deployments of fifty
servers at once or deployment abstractions for hundreds of people (my
fancy talk for PaaS).</p>
<p>In any case, things have changed. Deploying Python web apps is as
trivial as deploying PHP code.</p>
<p>For developers I see great times ahead.</p>

<a href="https://consumernotebook.com/jetbrains-pycharm/4f4ad5b861e9e4000e000000/">PyCharm</a>,
and NotePad on Windows. I try to make a brave face of it and for the
most part I succeed.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you know how you sometimes wish deep inside that the
fairy tales of youth were actually true? Or that there was a zombie
apocalypse and you got the chance to show off how all your eclectic
skills and pursuits would make you a survival genius? Well, I feel that
way about TextMates 2 being released in my lifetime. Alas, stark reality
stares me in the face; yet I cling to hope.</p>
<p>Alright, sometimes I dabble in Sublime Text 2. I've played with
PyCharm. In 2010 I even worked on a project where use of
<a href="https://consumernotebook.com/pydev/4f4ad5d55a4c6f000d000000/">PyDev</a> was
mandatory. When I touch servers it's EMACS, Vi, or even Nano. And yet
to TextMate I always return.</p>
<p>Is TextMate dead? Probably. And yes, someday I'll switch over to
something else, probably Sublime Text 2. In order to be certain I'm
starting to <a href="https://consumernotebook.com/lists/pydanny/complete-list-of-python-editors/">list all the Python
editors</a>
so I can review them properly before switching.</p>

<h1>Keynote</h1>
<p>I never liked Powerpoint. I tried to use Google Presentations for years.
Finally I tried Apple's Keynote for presentations and it was an amazing
decision. It's simple, easy, and remains out of my way. To make code
pretty I copy/paste pygmentized code and it just works.</p>

<h1><a href="https://rtfd.org">Read the Docs</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wikis are where documentation goes to die."</p>
<p>-- Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm of the opinion that Python open source projects that don't have
Sphinx documentation are not ready for production use. And if I have to
decide between two projects that are close in capability and one of them
isn't on Read the Docs, then you know which way I'll go.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I want my documentation as up-to-date as possible. Wikis often
fail in this, so do custom documentation solutions, and so does upload
tarballs to a service. You should be using the same patterns for
documentation as you do coding. Use Read the Docs.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a></h1>
<p>When I first heard that Heroku had become yet-another-Python-PAAS, I
shrugged. The field is crowded. We've tried a bunch, but never felt
like committing a real project to this type of service.</p>
<p>After a coding contest in October over in Hollywood where <a href="https://rdegges.com">Randall
Degges</a> served as sys admin for the project and
tried out Heroku, I was impressed. Heroku provided a nice command-line
interface and had an impressive feature set on it's own. A stand-out
feature I noticed was the <a href="https://add-ons.heroku.com">add-ons</a>, which
are Heroku moderated third-party plug-ins for their service. Finally, it
didn't hurt that Heroku has the staff to provide 24/7 coverage of their
servers.</p>
<p>We decided to give it a try and the results are that <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer
Notebook</a> is hosted by Heroku. We're more
than pleased, and I'll be blogging about the advantages of PaaS over
doing-servers-yourself in a future article.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a href="https://agilebits.com/store">1Password</a></h1>
<p>For all my umpteen accounts they all have different, crazy obscure
passwords. All I need to do is remember one password and I've got
access to them. What is even better is that it allows me to look up
passwords in a crowded room - they are kept obfuscated by the password
<code>****</code> field. So much better than trying to keep it all in my head, or
relying on weird coding patterns.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a></h1>
<p>Yup, I eat my own dogfood. It lets me <a href="https://consumernotebook.com/grids/~pydanny/">build comparison
grids</a> or look at what
<a href="https://consumernotebook.com/grids/r1chardj0n3s/10-android-tablets/">other people are
comparing</a>.
I can <a href="https://consumernotebook.com/lists/~pydanny/">list stuff for any
purpose</a>, and turn the
content of those lists into grids. It is still in BETA, so things are
still under development. However, on the other side, since I'm the one
building and using it, I get to determine the features going in or
coming out.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Mac OS X</h1>
<p>I started as an Apple user:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/6933443849/"><img src="/images/6933443849_51316a7cb7.jpg" alt="Me at 14-ish years of age sitting in from of the Apple 2"></a></p>
<p>I use Mac OS X professionally and have done so since 2006. However,
between autumn of 1985 and 2006 I used MS/DOS and Windows (deployments
usually to Unix/Linux). Not by choice but by hard reality of management
decision. In September of 2006 as I started to learn Python work gave me
an old, discarded Macbook Pro. Since then coding on OS X and then
deploying on Linux has been my pattern. I've followed this pattern ever
since, and I'm going to hit six years now as an OS X user.</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[PyCon Australia 2011 Review]]></title>
        <id>https://daniel.feldroy.com/pycon-australia-2011-review</id>
        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/pycon-australia-2011-review"/>
        <updated>2012-02-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In June of 2011 I had the good fortune of having my then girlfriend,
Audrey Roy, now fiancee, <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/06/im-going-to-pycon-australia.html">invited to present a keynote speech at PyCon
Australia
2011</a>.</p>
<p>I was terribly excited for her to get that invitation, and that
excitement was compounded when they allowed me to present on
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer%60:">Confessions of Joe
Developer</a>.</p>
<p>Travel is a passion of mine, and it's only been since 2007 that I've
gotten a chance to do much seeing of the world. Australia was always
this distant goal of mine, but I never thought I would get the chance to
go. Fortunately, my assumption was wrong and we landed on August 18th in
Sydney, Australia!</p>
<p>Audrey <a href="https://audreyr.posterous.com/thank-you-pycon-au">wrote her own statement about the
event</a> right after we
were done. She's good that way. Okay then, off to my own review. This
is belated, but better late then never, right?</p>
<h1>Conference Rooms</h1>
<p>The Sydney Masonic Center was the venue and it was a really curious
building. They built it a while ago, then apparently grafted an office
building onto the top of the temple. <strong>You have to see it to believe
it</strong>.</p>
<p>The main temple room was room, interesting, and fun. The acoustics, to
my limited ear, seemed quite good. The alternative rooms for some of the
tracks were small presentation rooms, which did quite nicely except when
the organizers chose popular talks for small rooms and things
overflowed. Everyone was good natured about that and we all just worked
it out.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Great</strong></p>
<h1>Speakers</h1>
<p>I'm partial but I think the opening keynote by Audrey Roy about
diversity was wonderful. Mary Gardinar also talk about open source
projects trying to change the world that need our support. Raymond
Hettiger seriously delivered the goods with another version of his
amazing talk about what makes Python great. Whatever you do, go and see
it as many times as possible because he changes it each and every time.
Richard Jones' presentation on the <a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/zen_of_python.html">Zen of
Python</a>
was very solid too, and I'll use this as an opportunity to promote my
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/that">Anti-Zen of Python</a>.</p>
<p>When it came time for me to present on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer%60:">Confessions of Joe
Developer</a>,
I finished way too early; plus me and Audrey felt the talk was not
technical enough. Even though the reception for my talk was very
positive, based on that experience and observation we ramped up the
technical content for DjangoCon US and I delivered a much stronger talk.
I want to thank the Australian Python community for being a wonderful
audience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/index.html">rest of the talks I saw were all quite
good</a>,
in fact the <a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/decorators.html">one on
decorators</a>
was incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Super</strong></p>
<h1>Conference Meals</h1>
<p>The night before the conference, Frends/mentors Russell Keith-Magee and
Malcolm Tredennick took me to a sushi-train place and we gobbled down
some very nice raw seafood. Call me silly, but sushi on moving plates
just tastes better! Thanks guys!</p>
<p>In between talks they served nice little sandwiches. The coffee bar had
lovely Flat Whites and considering the quality of dairy in Australia I
was very happy with the break food.</p>
<p>The first night of the conference they served an amazing, amazing meal.
The lamb was like nothing I've tasted before - my best way of
describing it was "<em>so this is how lamb is supposed to taste</em>". We
also got served Pavlova, which Audrey really enjoyed.</p>
<p>The last evening of the conference we went out to a famous Sydney
gastropub/brewery and got kangaroo and crocodile pizza. The kangaroo was
outstanding, but the alligator wasn't my thing.</p>
<p>After the conference we went with Graham Dumpleton to a wonderful Dim
Sum place and I stuffed myself silly while Audrey quizzed Graham on
WSGI. I was sleepy for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Pounds gained? Many.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Superb</strong></p>
<h1>Parties</h1>
<p>There were some lovely dinners and hang-outs. It was incredible putting
faces to names and personalities. Everyone looked as I imagined, which
meant they looked smashing. Events tended to be lower key, which can
make for some wonderfully nice, cozy conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Good</strong></p>
<h1>Accommodations</h1>
<p>There was no official conference hotel so we stayed at World Hotel - in
easy walking distance of the conference center. It wasn't cheap, but
I've learned from painful experience that when you travel to a
conference, you want to spend your time at the conference, not going
to-and-from a cheap hotel five miles away.</p>
<p>The staff of the hotel were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately they
were working around the limitations of their building. The rooms were
really tiny and rather stuffy. Normally that isn't an issue since we
spend a lot of our time outside the room, but in this case Audrey was
polishing her talk and needed a quiet room.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Average but not the fault of the conference</strong></p>
<h1>Sprints</h1>
<p>We talked with Richard Jones about PyPI authentication issues, and he
decided to go with OpenID. Personally, I would prefer OAUTH but I'll
take whatever I can get. On the behalf of the community Mark Rees
implemented OpenID on PyPI at the sprint so things like
<a href="https://opencomparison.org">https://opencomparison.org</a> can support the community better. One goal
at PyCon 2012 is to get that working as another authentication system.</p>
<p>Otherwise I closed bugs and worked lintification of the project. Audrey
and a couple Australian PyLadies, Elena Williams and Jenny Nguyen,
worked some core Django documentation tickets. We didn't get as much
done as we hoped thanks to an outside distraction, but the organization
of the sprints was top-notch.</p>
<p>During the sprint, those crazy Australians taught us how to do a <strong>Tim
Tam Slam</strong>. It's rather scary and not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p><strong>Result: Great</strong></p>
<h1>Overall Result</h1>
<p>The conference was run professionally. The leadership was on the ball.
The few issues that cropped up were taken care of, certainly better then
what I would have done. Thank you everyone who put it together or just
gave us a great time: Tim Ansell, Richard Jones, Nick Coghlan, Russell
Keith McGee, Graham Dumpleton, Malcolm Tredennick and many others.</p>
<p>Australia was amazing. The people were wonderful. I wish we had more
time to go sightseeing and relax, but we were off all too quickly. I
could write a book about the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Combined Result: Great</strong></p>

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/my-pycon-2012-schedule"/>
        <updated>2012-02-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here I was thinking that this year's PyCon wasn't going to be so busy
because I didn't submit a talk or tutorial. Ha! What the heck was I
thinking?</p>
<p>Here's what I've already got in the works.</p>
<h1>Wednesday, March 7th</h1>
<p>Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this
drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the
evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.</p>
<h1>Thursday, March 8th</h1>
<p>I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. <a href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&#x26;t=1c9a94.43">Have you
submitted a question
yet</a>?</p>
<p>In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference.
That's always a blast.</p>
<h1>Friday, March 9th</h1>
<p>PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin.
These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/64/">Introduction to
Metaclasses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/">The Art of
Subclassing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/249/">Data, Design,
Meaning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/246/">Code Generation in Python: Dismantling
Jinja</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some
of these talks is going to hurt.</p>
<p>In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party
and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.</p>
<h1>Saturday, March 10th</h1>
<p>I'll be at the <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a>
<a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html">Startup
Row</a>
booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new
companies.</p>
<p>In the evening I'm hosting the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon Capoeira Open
Space</a>. We've
got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five
people currently signed up to participate (<a href="https://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira">there's still room for
signups</a>). Even if you don't want to play
a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch.
Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can
assure you've seen them in the movies.</p>
<h1>Sunday, March 11th</h1>
<p>More talks!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/482/">Transifex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/301/">Sketching a better
product</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/66/">Building A Python-Based Search
Engine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/168/">Diversity in
practice</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15</h1>
<p>Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.</li>
<li>OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and
BitBucket OAUTH.</li>
<li>Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.</li>
<li>Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some
other planned projects.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Me and Audrey have been working hard on <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer
Notebook</a>, a Python/Django based project.
We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and found out this morning we've
been accepted. <strong>Hooray!</strong></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html">PyCon StartUp Row winner's
post</a>,
here is a little bit of what we're about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines
are gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with
ads, have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs.
<a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a> is working to solve
this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with product comparison
grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on <a href="https://djangopackages.com">Django
Packages</a> and <a href="https://opencomparison.org">Open
Comparison</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just so you know, <a href="https://us.pycon.org">PyCon</a> in North America is the
biggest gathering for the international Python community. The conference
this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is sold-out at 1500+
attendees, but could have easily sold out several times that number. The
talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible, and I'm
delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex,
Python Packages, and <a href="https://www.weddinglovely.com/">Wedding Lovely</a>.</p>
<p>Please check out <a href="https://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a> right
now and also visit our PyCon booth on Saturday, March 10th and we'll
show you what we're doing.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rather than hard-code the configuration into a Python based settings

        <link href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/django-uni-form-end-of-life"/>
        <updated>2012-02-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started on django-uni-form in January 2009. In order to use
<a href="https://pinaxproject.com">Pinax</a> on an internal social network for
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> HQ, we had to render all content, including
forms, <a href="https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html#section-508">Section
508</a>
compliant. Rather than rewrite the html for all 50+ forms that existed
in the Pinax 0.5.x framework at that time, I decided to minimize my work
and automate things. <a href="https://jtauber.com">James Tauber</a> gave guidance
and insight, my co-workers were supportive, and <a href="https://enn.io">Jannis
Leidel</a> suggested the Uni-form library. The name <strong>Django
Uni-Form</strong> was obvious, and lo the project was named.</p>
<p>Looking at the old, extremely deprecated <a href="https://code.google.com/p/django-uni-form/">Google Code site for
django-uni-form</a>, I see that
the first commit happened on January 7th, 2009. That was for version
0.1, with some core code that was literally a merger between the Django
form example on how to integrate divs into forms and the simplest
template tag I could figure out.</p>
<p>The python code in <code>uni_form/templatetags/uni_form.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.template import Context, Template
from django.template.loader import get_template
from django import template


register = template.Library()

@register.filter
def as_uni_form(form):
    template = get_template('templates/uni_form.html')
    c = Context({'form':form})

    return template.render(c)
</code></pre>
<p>The template tag code was nearly exactly copy/pasted from the starter
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/forms/#looping-over-the-form-s-fields">Django docs on
forms</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-django">{% for field in form %}

<h1>Days of django-uni-form</h1>
<p>Leading up to PyCon 2009 James Tauber suggested some things that lead to
the
<a href="https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html#form-helpers">FormHelpers</a>,
and we hammered out the API on IRC. We knew it crossed the rigid lines
between Model-View-Template, but sometimes it's advantageous to break a
few rules and abstractions in order to get better things down the road</p>
<p>At PyCon 2009 with the mentoring of Jannis, James, and <a href="https://twitter.com/brosner">Brian
Rosner</a>, I moved the project from google
code to <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form">Github</a>. Jannis
released it on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/">PyPI</a> and I followed the
pattern he showed me for two years. Yeah, I learned tons under those
guys.</p>
<p>After PyCon 2009 a pull request with the
<a href="https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/helpers.html#layouts">Layout</a>
helper was provided. It took some work to make it pass all the tests and
use cases, but the end result was definition of form layout in the
Python. This broke the rigid battle lines of Model-View-Template and
left purists screaming in agony, but it certainly made working with
forms in Django trivially easy.</p>
<p>Lots of people started to use the project across projects like Pinax and
organizations like NASA, <a href="https://pbs.org">PBS</a>, Discovery Channel,
various newspapers and many others. Lots of pull requests came in and
the features grew.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://twitter.com/arowla">Alice Rowland</a> submitted the first
<a href="https://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> docs, and it was her work that really
helped get me started on doing lots of Sphinx work.</p>
<p>And, all the way into 2011, pull requests for Django Form Sets started
to come rolling in, and almost none were of acceptable quality. They
never came with documentation, tests, and almost always broke existing
tests really hard. Since I'm not a huge fan of Django FormSets, I
didn't want to put in a ton of effort making them work. I believe one
of them was pretty good, but life was crazy busy at the time and I let
it slide. Apologies to whoever it was gave me a working FormSet pull
request with documentation, tests, and working code.</p>
<p>Long periods were going by without new versions. I admit I often slow
about accepting pull requests. Life was busy and reviewing the incoming
code took a lot of time. Browser cross-checking, running tests, and more
was really time consuming. I tried to get others to become co-leads on
the project, but invariably they didn't have time to do it. Note: If
someone asks you to co-lead something, respond in 24 hours.</p>
<h1>Enter Miguel Araujo</h1>
<p>After PyCon 2011, when there was some unpleasant stress in my life, I
woke up cranky one morning and mouthed off on twitter to this guy who
asked me to accept a pull request on django-uni-form. This guy tweeted
back to me saying I ought to be nicer since I had a library people
liked.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>I apologized to the guy (<a href="https://twitter.com/maraujop">Miguel Araujo</a>)
and remembered my manners. Over the next couple of months we chatted via
Twitter and Github's messaging system. He was smart, trustworthy, and
passionate about everything he did. I knew I had found my co-lead. He
responded promptly and I gave him commit rights.</p>
<p>Working together (with him doing the vast majority of the work), we
moved the project into new releases. The architecture and design
changed, driven by discussions we had together. The code was cleaned up,
gnarly bits in there to support old versions of Python and Django kicked
out, and the documentation revised. The project had new life!</p>
<p>The only blip I saw with Miguel is my own fault of sometimes being too
nice as a project leader when it comes to accepting pull requests. <a href="https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#how-to-get-your-pull-request-accepted">I
believe pull requests should be really
atomic</a></p>
<ul>
<li>for one thing and one thing only with support tests and documentation.
Otherwise it becomes nigh impossible to incorporate them and these days
I reject multi-purpose pull requests. One pull request in particular
took a huge amount of debate and discussion to work in. I think after
that Miguel is much better at being upfront at the beginning about
rejecting pull requests with giant scopes.</li>
</ul>
<p>During all this I asked Miguel to take over the project, he accepted,
and <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/06/announcing-django-uni-form-080-beta.html">I even blogged my announcement his role as project
leader</a>.
Miguel is indeed very nice and after that fact he asked me to remain on
board as co-lead.</p>
<p>We finally met in September of 2011 and co-presented on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/advanced-django-forms-usage">Advanced Django
Form Usage at DjangoCon
2011</a>.
The deepest technical material we presented was authored by Miguel.
During our research he uncovered at least one bug in Django and got an
ancient bug closed. It was a great experience and I hope he'll
co-present with me in the future.</p>
<h1>django-uni-form is dead, long live django-crispy-forms</h1>
<p>The upside of django-uni-form is that it grew in features organically
thanks to my own needs and general community effort. The downside of
django-uni-form is that it grew in features organically thanks to my own
needs and general community effort. In any long running project there is
cruft and weird patterns that start to hurt after a while.
django-uni-form was no different.</p>
<p>So I'm making this absolutely official as of now. <strong>django-uni-form is
at it's end of life</strong>. It's done and kaput. No more pull requests will
be accepted and the issue tracker will be turned off shortly. Just so no
one is mistaken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>django-uni-form is deprecated. Use django-crispy-forms</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miguel asked if he could start the project anew, under a different name.
We both had been uncomfortable with the name <em>django-uni-form</em> for some
time, especially since it had almost nothing to do with Uni-form
anymore. In fact, I often using template overrides to avoid the Uni-form
HTML layout - the most common alternative being <a href="https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter
Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>We tossed around names for the project, but all of them were stupid,
especially mine. We are both huge fans and users of
<a href="https://github.com/brutasse/django-floppyforms">django-floppyforms</a>
(HTML5 form widget app), so my fiancee, <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey
Roy</a>, suggested django-crispy-forms. And lo, the
project was named.</p>
<p>Right now
<a href="https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms</a>
has an improved API, better performance, and supports both Twitter
bootstrap forms 2.0 and UniForm. Adding new form layouts will be easier,
and feature controls will be better.</p>
<p>What you should be using now is
<a href="https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms</a>.
Don't worry about changing over as there are <a href="https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/en/d-0/migration.html">migration
instructions</a>
on the <a href="https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/">excellent
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Try it. You'll like it. :-)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://us.pycon.org">PyCon</a> tutorial on Django in Depth was ending.
I had been sitting next to my friend <a href="https://djangrrl.com/">Barbara</a> and
we got up to go when I heard a feminine voice ask: "Are you
<a href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette">bshaurette</a>?" I turned and it was like
I got punched in the gut.</p>
<p>It was the first time I met <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com">Audrey</a>. I remember
every detail of how she looked at that moment. The clothes she was
wearing, the part in her hair, that her eyes met mine, and that they
didn't turn away. I was immediately captivating, but fortunately
remembered to act like a gentleman. I tossed in a casual invitation to
her to join us for lunch, which I pulled off even though my heart was
pounding. Thankfully she accepted.</p>
<p>Life has been pretty much awesome ever since.</p>
<p>That was the day I met the love of my life.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Why Jekyll?</h1>
<p>I've had issues with Blogger for some time. After my fiancee, Audrey
Roy, moved her blog to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll</a>, I was
impressed enough to give it a try.</p>
<p>Why did it impress me?</p>
<h1>Code highlighting made easy</h1>
<p>I don't have to hand-craft HTML code to get google prettify in a post.
I just stick in a simple macro of 'highlight python' called like a
Django templatetag and I get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = 'Daniel Greenfeld'
for letter in name.split():
    print(letter)
</code></pre>
<p>This issue alone sums up why I don't do more blog posts with code.</p>
<h1>I don't want to maintain my own blog site</h1>
<p>A couple times I rolled out a blog on a site I stood up, but didn't
really feel like maintaining a site. I want someone else to do it. When
I write, I want someone else to worry about the details. I want to focus
on writing and nothing else.</p>
<h1>I want to be able to write without connection</h1>
<p>I need an internet connection to get my blogger posts to format right.
With Jekyll, I can just type away.</p>
<h1>Ability to publish via git</h1>
<p>My <a href="https://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org">https://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org</a> has really exploded in my own
usage and continued because it uses the same patterns I use in software
development. I'm used to the pattern of using Git to push up content,
so why use naked HTML? Sure, there are RST-to-HTML processors that I
could use to generate that HTML, but they always require an some amount
of manual correction. Jekyll, and it's alternatives,let me just write.</p>
<h1>Why not Jekyll?</h1>
<p>Jekyll is written in <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>. Nothing against ruby,
but I can't trivially work in that language the way I can in Python.
It's good to eat your own dogfood.</p>
<p>So I started looking at <a href="https://hyde.github.com/">hyde</a>,
<a href="https://blogofile.com/">blogofile</a>, and
<a href="https://pelican.readthedocs.org/">pelican</a> as alternatives. More on that
later.</p>
