            "content_html": "<p>On November 16, 2020, I started my first day of employment at <a href=\"https://octopusenergy.com/\">Octopus Energy</a>. Here's why I work there.</p>\n<h2>The Tech Stack</h2>\n<p>The entire tech stack is built on things I know. Python, Django, AWS, and modern JavaScript frameworks. It's been implemented in a very solid way, managing to be both conservative in approach yet innovative in design. While my previous experience has proven useful, I've had the chance to learn new and exciting things. Examples of things I've learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashistack on AWS</li>\n<li>React &#x26; Next</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yet when I think about it, the tech stack isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find the same tech stack in a thousand other organizations.</p>\n<h2>The People</h2>\n<p>It's always a delight to work with bright, positive-minded people who share your excitement for a job or cause. I like being around people who know things I do not, for no other reason than I can learn by osmosis. I enjoy being around them, and can't wait to meet them as the pandemic fades away.</p>\n<p>I also am amazed by the same treatment across different groups within the organization. No group or division is looked down on, be they software engineering, customer support, marketing, or executive leadership. We're all considered humans, not resources to be expended.</p>\n<p>Yet when I think about it, the people aren't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can find good people in a million other places.</p>\n<h2>The Diversity</h2>\n<p>Speaking of people, Octopus Energy is a diversity minded company. In my team alone, we have people from four different continents with five different native languages. We can admittedly do better on the gender front, and are striving to do better on that front. For many reasons this is important to me, for I believe it's not only the right thing to do, it also increases a team's strength to have a broader set of viewpoints.</p>\n<p>Yet when I think about it, the focus on diversity isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. Diversity-focused companies are not uncommon, and some have better numbers than Octopus.</p>\n<h2>The Business</h2>\n<p>Octopus Energy is a fast growing company spreading its tentacles to new markets and nations. In the months and years to come we're going to disrupt the energy business. In the meantime, in the brief 8 months I've been with the firm the valuation has doubled up to 3 billion dollars. It's exciting to be part of something growing explosively.</p>\n<p>Yet when I think about it, the business isn't the reason I love working for Octopus. I can think of other companies with this kind of explosive growth, some of whom I interviewed at when Octopus reached out to me.</p>\n<h2>The Reason I Love Working for Octopus</h2>\n<p>It's all about the climate.</p>\n<p>99% of the scientific community will tell you that the world is undergound rapid climate change. The signs are around us, with rapidly diminishing polar caps, rising sea levels, and increased instances of dramatic weather.</p>\n<p>For years I've felt there was nothing meaningful I could do. Yes, I recycled, composted, reduced flight travel, and found (and continue to find) other ways to lower my carbon footprint, but I'm just one person. The difference I have been making has been one amongst billions. And with the birth of my daughter in 2019, my concerns grew. I want her to have a world as beautiful as the one I had.</p>\n<p>I wanted to do more about climate change.</p>\n<p>I considered political activism, but I'm a realist. Governments around the world lack the long-term political will to do what's necessary to address climate change. They are too beholden to the deep wallets of the fossil fuel industry. In the US, special tax breaks and subsidies defer the costs and high expenses of the fossil fuel companies. We're  essentially paying out welfare to billionaires and their employees. And even if a green-focused coalition comes to power and removed these financial incentives, what happens when they get voted out?</p>\n<p>I wanted an option that bypassed the governments.</p>\n<p>Then one day I realized that capitalism might be the answer.</p>\n<h3>Capitalism as the Answer to Climate Change</h3>\n<p>For better or worse, for centuries capitalism has been a driving force for progress. The European conquest of the world was executed primarily by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trading_companies\">trading companies</a>. The growth of fossil fuels in the late 19th century to today was through national and multinational companies. In the past 15 years, the rise of Facebook, Amazon, and Google was driven by capitalism. While it could be argued that none of these were healthy in progress or result, one cannot deny their success.</p>\n<p><em>What if the solution to climate change was through capitalism?</em></p>\n<p>Even if customers don't believe in climate change, they can't ignore the fact the renewable energy is just cheaper than fossil fuels. Simply put, a solar farm or windmill doesn't require constant purchases of fuel to generate electricity. No matter a person's beliefs, in general they will move toward cheaper utility costs, especially when combined with improved customer experience.</p>\n<p>And that's where Octopus Energy comes in.</p>\n<p>Octopus Energy taps into the same forces of capitalism as its predecessors. By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, by selling services that encourage people to reduce their carbon and general energy usage, Octopus can make a direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company means it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the fossil fuels companies.</p>\n<p>That's why I work at Octopus Energy: Because they are giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 24+ years of professional software development to build out <a href=\"https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies\">Kraken, our customer focus retail energy platform</a>. They have literally given me a chance to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids.</p>\n<p>The way I look at it, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p>To learn more about what Octopus is doing to save the world, <a href=\"https://octopusenergy.group/\">check out Octopus Energy Group</a>.</p>\n<p>Interested in working with me at Octopus with a mission to save the world? <a href=\"https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies\">Check out our careers page</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h1>Recap of 2020</h1>\n<h2>I got a job saving the planet</h2>\n<p>For years I've been worried about climate change. I've tried to live a mostly ecologically friendly life, and this year I dived in with making compost for the garden. However, seeing the lack of consistent political will to correct the problem has had me worried.</p>\n<p>So I was delighted that when I started to look for jobs in the autumn I was contacted by several firms attempting to address the problem. I've always thought that finance is a great motivator, albeit all-too-often the results are negative (the petroleum and coal industries are examples).</p>\n<p>Ultimately I went with <a href=\"https://octopus.energy/\">Octopus Energy</a>, a company that is to borrow a phrase, disrupting the legacy power industry in areas with free-er energy markets (UK, Australia, Germany, Texas, Japan). They have embraced renewable energies as a source of power, which is good because it is cheaper than fossil fuels. Even if customers don't believe in global climate change they won't be able to ignore the fact renewables are a cheaper source of energy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy\"><img src=\"/images/octologo.png\" alt=\"Octopus Logo 2019\"></a></p>\n<p>In any case, I can't begin to say how wonderful it is being part of a company whose mission is to address climate change. It's like all my skills and talents are now superpowers being used to save the world.</p>\n<p>If you live in the US, UK, Germany, Australia, or Japan and want to join me using our various skills and talents to help save the world, <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy\">here's your chance</a>. We've got lots of <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy\">openings</a>, including for those who know <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/octoenergy\">Python and Django</a>.</p>\n<h2>My daughter grew</h2>\n<p>Uma grew in size and intellect. The photo below demonstrates the changes in her over just 8 months. Seeing her expand in awareness and understanding is a journey I never imagined. The challenges in raising her have been met with happiness by myself and Audrey. Her presence also drove me toward the new job at Octopus Energy I took on in the autumn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uma-2020.png\" alt=\"Uma growing\"></p>\n<h2>I learned to garden</h2>\n<p>Audrey and I once again tried our hand at gardening. In the past, our efforts were stymied by travel and work. Now, being home 99.9% of the year we finally managed to garner some success besides growing flowers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/bounty-2020.png\" alt=\"Bounty for 2020\"></p>\n<p>I got into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost\">composting</a>. The science of it is fascinating, you mix kitchen scraps and yard waste, add water, and depending on the method in anywhere from days to weeks to months you have soil that plants love.</p>\n<h2>I quarantined</h2>\n<p>Rather than risk me, family, and friends members, I entered quarantine until the COVID-19 pandemic was under control. It's not been easy, there are times I am restless. I've missed events, the worst of which are funerals of those who died. Nevertheless, I refused to become a statistic or cause others harm.</p>\n<h2>I voted</h2>\n<p>I voted on November 3rd. I believe voting should be mail-in or by the internet. I also believe the United States should get rid of gerrymandering and the electoral college.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular vote all the way!</strong></p>\n<h2>I wrote books</h2>\n<p>More on this in a different blog post, but here's what I got out the door:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x\">Two Scoops of Django 3.x</a> - Latest edition of our Two Scoops of Django series</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/a-wedge-of-django\">A Wedge of Django</a> - Basic Django tutorial</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.feldroy.com/collections/impossible-hero-books/products/necronaut\">Necronaut</a> - Horror science fiction novelette</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Resolutions for 2021</h1>\n<h2>Be the best father I can be</h2>\n<p>My daughter is part of my legacy, what will exist on this planet after I am gone. She motivates me to do my best at work and to take care of myself better so I can be stronger for her.</p>\n<p>I will help her grow into the person she wants to be. That means teaching her new things, keeping her safe, and being there for her. I will treasure the time I have with her at this age and never take her presence for granted.</p>\n<h2>Lose my COVID-19</h2>\n<p>Yeah, I put on weight. Working to get it off. Steps I've taken:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eating less</li>\n<li>Ramping up my home exercise program</li>\n<li>Working at a standing desk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the pandemic is over I plan to restart my journey into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>\n<h2>I will quarantine</h2>\n<p>I don't need to travel to do my job. I can get by without sitting in a restaurant to eat. I can talk to family, friends, and co-workers via any number of communication methods.</p>\n<p>Even after I'm vaccinated, until the pandemic is under control, I'll keep up this behavior.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know some of you reading this disagree with me. You may think that I'm being too cautious. However, right now in Los Angeles huge numbers of people I know or are in my neighborhood ignored all the quarantine rules. The result is that the hospitals are overwhelmed, the staff are exhausted, and the ambulances impossible to get because they can't offload patients. Non-COVID emergency issues go untreated, meaning surviving treatable allergic reactions or heart attacks is no longer so certain.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I'm staying in quarantine and not doing anything stupid with me or my family's safety until things die down.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, until just a few days ago that process didn't include the cover. Instead, covers were inserted manually using Adobe Acrobat.</p>\n<p>While that manual process worked, <a href=\"https://github.com/roygreenfeld/django-crash-course/issues/132\">it came with predictable consequences</a>.</p>\n<h2>Merging the PDFs</h2>\n<p>This part was easy and found in any number of blog articles and Stack Overflow answers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1: Install <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/\">pypdf2</a></li>\n<li>Step 2: Write a script as seen below</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger\n\nnow = datetime.now()\n\npdfs = [\n  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',\n  '_output/dcc.pdf',\n]\n\nmerger = PdfFileMerger()\n\nfor pdf in pdfs:\n    merger.append(pdf)\n\nmerger.write(\"releases/beta-20200226.pdf\")\nmerger.close()    \n</code></pre>\n<p>It was at this point that we discovered that our new file, <code>releases/beta-20200226.pdf</code>, was missing most of the metadata. Oh no!</p>\n<h2>Adding the Metadata</h2>\n<p>According to the PyPDF2 docs, <a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/PdfFileMerger.html#PyPDF2.PdfFileMerger.addMetadata\">adding metadata is very straight-forward</a>. Just pass a <code>dict</code> into the <code>addMetadata()</code> function. I inserted this code right before the call to <code>merger.write()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">merger.addMetadata({\n    \"Title\": \"Django Crash Course\",  \n    \"Authors\": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',\n    \"Description\": \"Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x\",\n    \"ContentCreator\": \"Two Scoops Press\",\n    \"CreateDate\": \"2020-02-26\",\n    \"ModifyDate\": \"2020-02-26\",\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The PDF built! Yeah! Time to open it up and see the results!</p>\n<p>Alas, no metadata showed up.</p>\n<p>Then I spent a long time with trial-and-error trying to get the metadata to show up properly. While there are lots of Python-related articles on <strong>extracting</strong> metadata using PyPDF2, I struggled to find anything that explained how to add metadata.</p>\n<h2>Doing My Homework</h2>\n<p>After a bunch of research (googling, stack overlow-ing, and visiting forums) I found a wonderful book on O'Reilly called <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/\">PDF Explained</a> by John Whitington. Much credit to John Whitington, he's a good writer and very knowledgable on the topic of PDF.</p>\n<p>For my purposes, the two critical sections were found in Chapter 4 of PDF Explained:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries</li>\n<li>https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#dates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based off what I read, I established the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every metadata field name had to be prefixed with <code>/</code></li>\n<li>Stick to the metadata names found in chapter 4</li>\n<li>Follow the date format supplied in chapter 4</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Writing the Code!</h2>\n<p>Now armed with my rules I returned to the code. This is what I came up with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from datetime import datetime\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger\n\npdfs = [\n  'images/Django_Crash_Course_5.5x8in.pdf',\n  '_output/dcc.pdf',\n]\n\nmerger = PdfFileMerger()\n\nfor pdf in pdfs:\n    merger.append(pdf)\n\n# Make PDF datestamp\nnow = datetime.now()\npdf_datestamp = now.strftime(\"D:%Y%m%d%H%M%S-8'00'\")\n\n# https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pdf-explained/9781449321581/ch04.html#didentries\n# Fields are **precisely** named\nmerger.addMetadata({\n    \"/Author\": 'Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld',\n    \"/Title\": \"Django Crash Course\",\n    \"/Subject\": \"Covers Python 3.8 and Django 3.x\",\n    \"/Creator\": \"Two Scoops Press\",\n    \"/CreationDate\": pdf_datestamp,\n    \"/ModDate\": pdf_datestamp,\n})\n\n# Write the release\nversion = f\"beta-{now.strftime('%Y%m%d')}\"\nmerger.write(f\"releases/{version}.pdf\")\nmerger.close()\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The lesson I learned writing this little utility is that as useful as Google and Stack Overflow might be, sometimes you need to explore reference manuals. Which, if you ask me, is a lot of fun. :-)</p>\n<p>Speaking of reference manuals, while I referenced the online version of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006H4DAE6/?tag=mlinar-20\">PDF Explained</a> to get my work done, I've ordered a kindle version of the book. It's the least I can do.</p>\n",

This makes getting everything right across different operating systems for students very straightforward.  These tools also empower us to create data-focused extensions to the core book.</p>\n<h3>Class-Based Views</h3>\n<p>Our opinion is that beginners should be taught Class-Based Views (CBVs) from the start. Knowing CBVs from the start makes understanding critical CBV-based packages like <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> much easier. We also believe that the explicit nature of the <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, and other HTTP methods is easier for beginners to grasp. Years of success at levelling up people with Django supports our opinion.</p>\n<h3>Theme!</h3>\n<p>Tutorial themes are cheesy. That's why we use cheese as the theme for the main project in the book!</p>\n<p><em>We also want to be the most successful dairy-themed tech book authors in the universe.</em></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you'd like to buy the book (or learn more about it), do so on the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/django-crash-course\">The Django Crash Course page on roygreenfeld.com</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>There's an anti-pattern in the development world, and it's for using executable code as a means to store configuration values. In the Python universe, you sometimes see things like this in settings modules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Warning: This is an anti-pattern!\ntry:\n    from .local_settings import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    pass\n</code></pre>\n<p>What people do is have a <code>local_settings.py</code> file that has been identified in a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Therefore, for local development you have your project running through an <strong>executable code file outside of version control</strong>.</p>\n<p>If this sounds uncomfortable to you, then you are on the right track. Executable code <strong>always</strong> needs to be in version control.</p>\n<p>A better approach is to place secrets and keys into environment variables. If you don't like that, or can't use it due to your environment, stick those values into JSON, YAML, or TOML files.</p>\n<p>So what can happen if you allow the <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern into your project?</p>\n<h3>The <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern</h3>\n<p>The <code>local_settings</code> anti-pattern means that you can have executable code in production that usually can't be viewed by developers trying to debug problems. If you've ever experience it, this is one of the worst production debugging nightmares.</p>\n<h3>It worked fine on my laptop!</h3>\n<p>What works locally and tests successfully can throw subtle bugs that won't be discovered until it's too late. Here's a real-world example of what can happen that I helped resolve for a client last year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Project had been using a third-party package for slugification for years. Configuration done in settings.</li>\n<li>Developer decided to write their own slugification project. Worked great locally, so they made changes across the site to account for the new behavior.</li>\n<li>Tests did not account for edge cases in the new slugification library.</li>\n<li>Appeared to work in local development, staging, and even production.</li>\n<li>A few days later customers in certain regions of the world started to complain about records being unreachable.</li>\n<li>No one can figure out why production is behaving differently.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was brought in (and I billed them). First thing I check is for this sad code snippet in their settings modules</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Warning: This is an anti-pattern!\ntry:\n    from .local import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    pass\n</code></pre>\n<p>They had <code>executable</code> code outside of version control. What worked for the developer, didn't work the same everywhere else. Enough that it caused subtle bugs that weren't caught by humans or formal tests. Subtle developer bugs grew into serious bugs when encountered by real users.</p>\n<p>And what was really bad is that these serious bugs were impossible to debug at first because the deployed code didn't match what was in someone's <code>local_settings.py</code> file.</p>\n<h3>But I won't make these mistakes!</h3>\n<p>People often say indignantly, \"I'm not stupid like you, I don't make this kind of mistake.\"</p>\n<p>Yet about once a year for the past 20 years I resolve or help resolve an issue stemming from executable code that wasn't tracked in version control.</p>\n<p>I believe that all of us coders, no matter how talented and experienced, can and will make stupid mistakes. That's why good engineers/coders follow best practices - to help catch ourselves when we do something stupid. If you believe you can personally avoid making stupid mistakes in programming, I've got a bridge in New York City I can sell you.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, why not do the <code>smart</code> thing and put all executable code in version control? You can put your secrets and keys in environment variables or configuration files. Done! Argument over!</p>\n<h3>How to handle location specific variables</h3>\n<p>Use either either environment variables or config files. Really. And don't take my word for it, look at all the deployment tools and hosting services that recommend it (all of them do).</p>\n<p>To do this, either figure out your own process for handling them or use a third-party package. Personally, for Django I like the simplicity of having this function in my various settings modules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Good code!\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured\n\n\ndef get_env_var(var_name):\n    try:\n        return os.environ[var_name]\n    except KeyError:\n        error_msg = f\"Set the {var_name} environment variable\"\n        raise ImproperlyConfigured(error_msg)\n\n\nSECRET_KEY = get_env_var(\"SECRET_KEY\")\n</code></pre>\n<h3>I wrote a book to stop antipatterns</h3>\n<p>In 2012 I kept getting offered rescue projects because people were using anti-patterns, especially this one. It was frustrating to see the same mistakes again and again. So I started to write a book, <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11\">Two Scoops of Django</a>, designed to instruct people on how not to fall into anti-patterns like the one described in this article.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to buy my <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11\">book</a>, please read and embrace the config section of <a href=\"https://12factor.net/config\">The Twelve Factor App</a>.

            "content_html": "<p><img src=\"/images/EverestfromKalarPatarcrop.JPG\" alt=\"Everest from Kalar Patar\"></p>\n<p>Since around February of 2012, I've been publishing this blog as a static HTML site using <a href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\">Pelican</a>. The experience was pretty good, but over time I ran into a few problems with the fact that I never upgraded the site to match current versions of Pelican. Which meant the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My RSS feed didn't follow the modern W3C RSS/Atom specifications. So I haven't been published in <a href=\"https://https://planetpython.org/\">Planet Python</a> in years.</li>\n<li>As time went by, upgrading to modern Pelican became harder and harder. And trying to get it to work wasn't much fun either.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I started looking at other options. My requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All my old page links needed to work. I didn't want to have to cook up some kind of redirect system.</li>\n<li>I wanted to be able to make customizations without fighting through a complex extension system.</li>\n<li>Theming needed to be easy.</li>\n<li>Markdown needed to be supported. While I like RestructuredText, the honest truth is that I can pour out my thoughts faster with Markdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With those requirements in mind, I got started reviewing other tools. I tried a bunch of options (Hugo, Lektor, Pelican again, etc) but none of them met my requirements to the degree I wanted.</p>\n<h2>Climbing the Moutain</h2>\n<p>Eventually, I decided the best course of action was to write my own blog engine with <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\">Flask</a> and host it on AWS Lambda via <a href=\"https://github.com/miserlou/zappa\">Zappa</a> with a JSON and Markdown backend. Using Flask and Zappa seemed like a good fit for me.</p>\n<p>The reason is that while our core engine at work is always Django, we use Flask on AWS Lambda to power many microservices. For persistence we have DynamoDB/Redis or Django-powered APIs.</p>\n<p>So one day this month I wrote up a blog engine that suited my requirements. I flung a theme on it and deployed it to AWS Lambda.</p>\n<p>Hooray! Mission accomplished!</p>\n<h2>Falling Off the Mountain</h2>\n<p>With pleasure, I asked friends to take a look at my new blog system. Immediately these friends started to tell me it was running slow.</p>\n<p>You see, it turns out if you load a <strong>huge JSON</strong> file for each page load AND render markdown on the server side, your site is going to be slow. Even after numerous optimizations the pages still loaded in seconds.</p>\n<h2>Climbing a Frozen Mountain</h2>\n<p>I thought about writing something to convert the JSON to native python objects. Or using an S3-located SQLite3 backend. But that felt like a lot of work to me and I wanted to get to writing.</p>\n<p>That's when my awesome wife suggested I render the blog out as static HTML and just put that on S3. She said if I needed custom elements, that's what I could host those on AWS Lambda via Zappa and load them with Javascript.</p>\n<p>Inspired by her idea, I installed <a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/\">Frozen-Flask</a> and a few minutes later I had a static version of my blog. I removed the pagination and was done.</p>\n<h2>Inside the Mountain</h2>\n<p>My new blog is built and deployed with the following backend components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Flask</li>\n<li>Boto3</li>\n<li>Markdown2</li>\n<li>feedgen</li>\n<li>Django (because it has the best <code>truncatewords_html</code> tools)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The markdown files that make up the content have metadata stored as JSON. That makes it easy to read and parse, but I have considered switching to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML\">TOML</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking out the window a few days ago I came up with a name for my blog engine: \"Mountain\".</p>\n<h2>Why Flask? Why Not Django?</h2>\n<p>Because Flask is better at doing work that doesn't involve SQL. And I don't want a SQL-powered blog. I want something that lets me write in markdown using my text editor. Mountain lets me do precisely that.</p>\n<h2>What's Next?</h2>\n<p>Here are some things I plan to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch from Disqus-powered comments to GitHub issue powered ones.</li>\n<li>Take a look at switching the metadata from JSON to TOML.</li>\n<li>Write an AWS Lambda-powered search backend for the blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>The end result of this is you'll probably see me writing more blog entries in the days to come. Mountain works exactly how I want it. It has removed some of the hindrances that slowed me down.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is my first blog post written in Markdown on the new blog. How cool is that?</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h1>Short Answer</h1>\n<p>You don't.</p>\n<h1>Long Answer</h1>\n<p>First off, let's get one thing out of the way. This isn't a bash on\nMongoDB. MongoDB works great with lots of things (Flask, Tornado, Node,\netc), but it's a mismatch with Django. In other words, this article is\nabout using the right tool for the right job.</p>\n<p>Second, I'm not speaking from ignorance. In fact, I have quite a bit of\nexperience combining MongoDB and Django. You can see some of my early\nwork with combining these tools in the defunct\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jazzband/django-mongonaut\">django-mongonaut</a>.</p>\n<p>Okay then, let's get into the background of this post: On various\nDjango help forums, you'll hear requests from new-ish Django developers\non how to use MongoDB with Django. Most of the time they want to replace\nthe Django ORM with calls to MongoDB. Here are the reasons I've heard\nso far.</p>\n<h1>The 90% Reason: JSON storage</h1>\n<p>Most of the time people want to replace SQL with MongoDB in Django, the\nreason is they want to store JSON data and search it.</p>\n<p>In which case, they should use <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#jsonfield\">Django's built-in implementation of\nPostgreSQL's JSON\nfield</a>.\nIt's not just a string field, it's fully searchable. Implementation\nexample below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.contrib.postgres.fields import JSONField\nfrom django.db import models\n\n\nclass Product(models.Model):\n\n    metadata = JSONField(null=True, blank=True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just save your data into this field using a JSON-serializable dict.\nIt's that easy. Even better, in this previous\n<a href=\"/pretty-formatting-json-django-admin.html\">article</a>,\nI show how you can pretty print the JSON in the Django admin.</p>\n<p>Using this field, you get all the built-in features of Django and a\nsearchable JSON field without the mess of stapling a non-relational\ndatabase (MongoDB) into a framework and vibrant ecosystem designed to\nwork with relational databases (Django).</p>\n<p>For those using MySQL instead of PostgreSQL, there's always\nDjango-MySQL's\n<a href=\"https://django-mysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_fields/json_field.html\">jsonfield</a>.</p>\n<h1>The 5% Reason: Performance</h1>\n<p>A fraction of people want to use MongoDB with Django because of supposed\nperformance reasons. Sure, if you run MongoDB without any write\nsafeguards and decide to forego database transactions, it will run\nfaster than any relational storage. However, that's a dangerously\ninsecure approach to things. It's simply not worth the risk of\ncorrupted data.</p>\n<p>Don't take my word for it, spend an hour searching for articles about\nwrite safety in MongoDB. Ignore the hype articles published by\nmongodb.com, read what real businesses and projects case studies have to\nsay.</p>\n<p>Also, if you want to speed database i/o up with Django, standard\npractice is to employ asynchronous tools such as Celery before switching\nout the datastore.</p>\n<h1>The 4% Reason: Scaling Up</h1>\n<p>Anyone who tells you that relational databases can't scale as well as\nMongoDB (or anything else) is selling you something. Or was sold on\nsomething and don't want to admit they bought the hype.</p>\n<p>Again, don't take my word for it, spend an hour searching for articles\nabout scaling issues with MongoDB. Again, ignore the marketing and read\nreal case studies.</p>\n<h1>The 1% Reason: Management</h1>\n<p>Every once in a while someone tells me that using MongoDB with Django is\na management decision. In which case, they should send their boss(es) to\nthis blog post.</p>\n<p>Management should know that Django is designed to be used with a\nrelational database backend (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and a key/value store\nfor ephemeral data (Redis, Memcached). Going beyond that design is going\nto make development slower and frustrate the team. Even if your team can\nwork around this issue, they'll be hampered by not being able to fully\nexploit tools within the Django ecosystem.</p>\n<h1>If You Must Use MongoDB, Use Flask Instead</h1>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with MongoDB. However, it's suboptimal when used\nwith Django. If you use it with correct write permissions, MongoDB\ndoesn't provide any speed benefits with Django. You also lose many of\nthe advantages of Django (database transactions, rock-solid security,\nforms, easy Django REST framework use, hundreds of third-party packages,\netc). There is quite a lot of things you are going to have to rewrite.</p>\n<p>And if you're going to have to rewrite that much of Django's\nfunctionality to use MongoDB, you might as well be using Flask.\nHonestly, this isn't a bad choice, as the flexibility of Flask makes it\nperfect for use with non-relational databases.</p>\n<p>I know, because this is how we use Flask on the job, which is not with\nrelational data.

Well, it's time\nto pick it up again!</p>\n<p>So here are my resolutions for 2018:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Weight down to 160.</li>\n<li>Work out for 60 minutes a day. I got lazy in the last year.</li>\n<li>Start martial arts again. Because of knee and ankle injuries,\nCapoeira is probably right out. Already up Kali/Escrima under\n<a href=\"https://valleycapoeira.com/about-us/contra-mestreguro-xingu/\">Guro</a>\nMestre Xingú instead.</li>\n<li>Write at least 3 books (last year we did 5 books, so this is\ndoable!). Out of those, one will be about coding in some way.</li>\n<li>Blog at least once a month, about anything. Python, Django,\nserverless coding, martial arts, whatever. And with this post,\nJanuary is done!</li>\n<li>Release some coding projects I can't talk about yet.</li>\n<li>Travel outside the USA. That looks to be a trip to Colombia to speak\nat <a href=\"https://www.pycon.co\">PyCon Colombia</a>! If you are in South\nAmerica, please meet me (and Audrey) there!

I did it in a text editor\n(Sublime) and saved the files to a git repo. The names of the files\ndetermined their order, chapters being named in this pattern:</p>\n<pre><code>the-darkest-autumn $ tree\n.\n├── 01_Beginnings.md\n├── 02_Town_of_Ravenna.md\n├── 03_Walls_of_Ravenna.md\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the book developed I thought about moving it to\n<a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a>. If you\ndon't know, Scrivener is an excellent tool for writing. It encourages\nyou to break up your work into chapters and scenes. The downside is that\nScrivener is complex (I want to write, not figure out software) and\n<a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#x26;t=11725\">Scrivener isn't designed for simultaneous\ncollaboration</a>.\nThe latter issue is a very serious problem, as I like to have others\nreview and comment on my writing as I go.</p>\n<p>What I really wanted to do is combine the chapter breaking of Scrivener\nwith the simplicity and collaboration of Google Docs. Preferably, I\nwould put the book chapters into Google Docs as individual files and\nthen send invites to my editor, wife, and my beta readers. By using\nGoogle Docs I could ensure anyone could access the work without having\nto create a new account and learn an unfamiliar system.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at this time Google Docs has no way to combine multiple\nGoogle Docs contained in one directory into one large document for\npublication. To use Google Docs thhe way I want involves manually\ncopy/pasting content from dozens of files into one master document any\ntime you want to update a work. With even 5 to 10 documents this is time\nconsuming and error prone (for me) to the point of being unusable. This\nis a problem because my fiction books have anywhere from 30 to 50\nchapters.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me, I know how to code. By using the Python programming\nlanguage, I can automate the process of combining the Google Docs into\none master file which can be converted to epub, mobi (kindle), or PDF.</p>\n<h1>How I Combine Google Doc Files</h1>\n<p>First, I download all the files in the book's Google Docs directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/selecting-files.png?12346\" alt=\"Selecting Files With Google Docs\"></p>\n<p>This generates and downloads a zip file called something like\ndrive-download-20170505T230011Z-001.zip. I use <code>unzip to open it</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>unzip drive-download-20170505T230011Z-001.zip -d the-darkest-autumn\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside the new the-darkest-autumn folder are a bunch of MS\nWord-formatted files named identically to what's stored on Google Docs:</p>\n<pre><code>$ tree the-darkest-autumn/\nthe-darkest-autumn\n├── 01. Beginnings.docx\n├── 02. Town of Ravenna.docx\n├── 03. Walls of Ravenna.docx\n├── 04. Gatehouse of Ravenna.docx\n├── 05. Courage.docx\n├── 06. To the Upper Valley.docx\n├── _afterward.docx\n├── _copyright.docx\n├── _dedication.docx\n└── _title.docx\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it's time to bring in the code.

I plan to enhance it with better fonts and chapter\nheaders, the goal to generate something as nice as what\n<a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/\">Draft2Digital</a> generates.</p>\n<p>I've considered adding the OAuth components necessary in order to allow\nfor automated downloading. The problem is I loathe working with OAuth.\nTherefore I'm sticking with the manial download process.</p>\n<p>For about a week I thought about leveraging it and my\n<a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> skills to build it as a paid\nsubscription service and rake in the passive income. Basically turn it\ninto a startup. After some reflection I backed off because if Google\nadded file combination as a feature, it would destroy the business\novernight.</p>\n<p>I've also decided not to package this up on Github/PyPI. While\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">Cookiecutter</a> makes it trivial\nfor me to do this kind of thing, I'm not interested in maintaining yet\nanother open source project. However, if someone does package it up and\ncredits me for my work, I'm happy to link to it from this blog post.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"/python-f-strings-are-fun.html\"><img src=\"/images/python-tip-from-pydanny.png\" alt=\"Python F-Strings Are Fun!\"></a></p>\n<p>In python 3.6 we saw the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/\">Literal String\nInterpolation</a>, or as they\nare known more commonly,\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings\">f-strings</a>.\nAt first I was hesitant because... well... we've got multiple string\ntools already available:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">one, two = 1, 2\n_format = '{},{}'.format(one, two)\n_percent = '%s,%s' % (one, two)\n_concatenation = str(one) + ',' + str(two)\n_join = ','.join((str(one),str(two)))\nassert _format == _percent == _concatenation == _join\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding f-strings to this mix didn't seem all that useful:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">_fstring = f'{one},{two}'\nassert _fstring == _format == _percent == _concatenation == _join\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was doubtful, but then I tried out f-strings on a non-trivial example.\nNow I'm hooked. Be it on local utility scripts or production code, I\nnow instinctively gravitate toward their usage. In fact, f-strings are\nso useful that going back to earlier versions of Python now feels\ncumbersome.</p>\n<p>The reason why I feel this way is that f-strings are concise but easy to\nunderstand. Thanks to intuitive expression evaluation I can compress\nmore verbose commands into smaller lines of code that are more legible.\nTake a look:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">_fstring = f'Total: {one + two}'  # Go f-string!\n_format = 'Total: {}'.format(one + two)\n_percent = 'Total: %s' % (one + two)\n_concatenation = 'Total: ' + str(one + two)\nassert _fstring == _format == _percent == _concatenation\n</code></pre>\n<p>The f-string example is four characters shorter than the closest\nalternative and is extremely easy to read. Indeed, put the f-string\nexample in front of a non-programmer and they'll understand it fast.\nThe same won't apply to the alternatives, odds are they'll ask what\n<code>.format()</code>, <code>str()</code>, and the <code>%</code> mean.</p>\n<h1>F-Strings Are Addictive</h1>\n<p>The conciseness and power of the intuitive expression evaluation can't\nbe understated. On the surface f-strings seem like a small step forward\nfor Python, but once I started using them I realized they were a huge\nstep in codability for the language.</p>\n<p>Now I'm hooked. I'm addicted to f-strings. When I step back to Python\n3.5 or lower I feel like less of a Python coder. Yes, I have a problem\nwith how much I lean on f-strings now, but I acknowledge my problem. I\nwould go to therapy for it, but I believe I can manage the addiction for\nnow.</p>\n<p>Okay, enough joking, f-strings are awesome. Try them out.</p>\n<h1>A Utility Script Example</h1>\n<p>We just released <a href=\"https://www.roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11\">Two Scoops of Django\n1.11</a>,\nwhich is written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">LaTeX</a>.

            "content_html": "<h1>How to Improve Your Coding Skills</h1>\n<p>This was my path. It may not be your path. This path also isn't in any\nparticular order, all of them apply from the moment you start on the\npath.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I coded. A lot. From silly little scripts to automating tasks to\nattempting full-blown projects. At work or for fun. I failed a lot,\nbut learned along the way.</li>\n<li>I didn't jump from language to language. Instead I stayed in a few\nplaces for years and focused my learning on those tools. My 19+ year\ncareer can be summed up as FoxPro then Java then Python. In the\nmiddle of things I picked up JavaScript. Sure, I've dallied with a\nfew things (Lisp, Haskell, Lua, Perl, ColdFusion, Go), but by\nstaying focused on a small set of tools I'm better than mediocre.</li>\n<li>I coded lots. Yes, this is a repeat of #1.</li>\n<li>Once I got the basics of a language, I looked up best practices for\neach of them. Then I religiously adhered to them, even becoming\ndogmatic about it. In general this means my code is more easily\nread. More easily debugged. And most importantly, more easily\nshared.</li>\n<li>Did I mention that I coded a lot? You can never get good at anything\nunless you practice. Another repeat of #1.</li>\n<li>I got over my fear/pride of asking questions. Well, mostly, I still\nam afraid/prideful from time to time. Honestly, by asking questions\nyou aren't showing what you don't know, you are showing you are\nwilling to learn. Also, the simple act of figuring out how to ask a\nquestion can put you in the right mindset to determine the answer\nyourself.</li>\n<li>As soon as I asked a question, whether or not I got an answer, I\ncoded some more. Code, code, code! Yet another repeat of #1</li>\n<li>Once I've gotten the hang of a language, I looked for cookbooks\nand/or pocket references on it. I prefer paper copies of tech books\n(everything else I read is electronic). The recipes in cookbooks\nbecome the foundation of my toolkit. The terse, easy-to-find\nreminders in the pocket reference mean less cognitive overload.</li>\n<li>I took those recipes and references and coded with them. Again and\nagain I coded. In work hours or play time. Practice makes perfect!\nWhy do I keep repeating #1?</li>\n<li>Over the years I've stayed with the easiest-to-learn stable\nIDEs/text editors. Yes, I know there are really powerful tools with\narcane commands (Vim, EMACS, etc), but I don't want to have to stop\nwhat I'm doing to learn new tools. I want to code, not tinker with\ndesktop tools or arcane text editors.</li>\n<li>And again, reference back to #1, I use the text editor to write\ncode. Code, code, code! Until my fingers and hands hurt, until I've\nhad to learn how to deal with carpal tunnel syndrome. Code, code,\ncode! It's like learning martial arts, guitar, or anything,\nrepetition of simple actions provides the confidence for you to\neither combine those actions into something greater or learn\nsomething more complex.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What I Wish I Had Done</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Studied computer science. If I could do it all over again, that\nwould have been the focus of my academic studies. It wouldn't\nreplace anything on my list, the path I've defined remains the\nsame. Code, code, code!</li>\n<li>It goes without saying I should have taken more tutorials. Nothing\ngives a kickstart like having an instructor, online or in-person,\nwho guides you down the right path. Then you can code, code, code!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Practice makes perfect, right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/code-code-code.html\"><img src=\"/images/code-code-code.png\" alt=\"Code, Code, Code\"></a></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Recently I was writing code to interact with a third-party API. The API\nchanges frequently, especially the data contained in responses. However,\nthat data has to be saved and periodically needs to be audited. I wanted\na data model flexible enough to handle these periodic changes without a\nlot of anguish, yet queryable. Since the API serves out queryable JSON,\nthis made it a no-brainer for using <code>django.contrib.postgres</code>'s\nJSONField.</p>\n<p>After a little bit of work, I had data samples to play with. Quickly my\nadmin filled with chunks of JSON that looked something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">{\"field_12\": 8, \"field_16\": 4, \"field_6\": 14, \"field_7\": 13, \"field_18\": 2, \"field_2\": 18, \"field_4\": 16, \"field_15\": 5, \"field_9\": 11, \"field_3\": 17, \"field_8\": 12, \"field_11\": 9, \"field_17\": 3, \"field_10\": 10, \"field_0\": 20, \"field_1\": 19, \"field_13\": 7, \"field_5\": 15, \"field_14\": 6}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Kind of illegible, right? And that's a simple, flat example with just\n20 keys. Imagine if this were a nested dictionary with 100 or 200\nfields. For reference, that's the kind of data that I had that makes\nthis kind of display nigh useless.</p>\n<p>So I cooked up this quick fix:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import json\nfrom pygments import highlight\nfrom pygments.lexers import JsonLexer\nfrom pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter\n\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n\nfrom .models import APIData\n\n\nclass APIDataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    readonly_fields = ('data_prettified',)\n\n    def data_prettified(self, instance):\n        \"\"\"Function to display pretty version of our data\"\"\"\n\n        # Convert the data to sorted, indented JSON\n        response = json.dumps(instance.data, sort_keys=True, indent=2)\n\n        # Truncate the data. Alter as needed\n        response = response[:5000]\n\n        # Get the Pygments formatter\n        formatter = HtmlFormatter(style='colorful')\n\n        # Highlight the data\n        response = highlight(response, JsonLexer(), formatter)\n\n        # Get the stylesheet\n        style = \"&#x3C;style>\" + formatter.get_style_defs() + \"&#x3C;/style>&#x3C;br>\"\n\n        # Safe the output\n        return mark_safe(style + response)\n\n    data_prettified.short_description = 'data prettified'\n\nadmin.site.register(APIData, APIDataAdmin)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The field remains the same, but we also get a display of nicely\nformatted data:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/admin-pretty-json.png\" alt=\"Admin Pretty JSON\">]</p>\n<p>Much better!</p>\n<p>There may be a package out there that does this already, perhaps even\nusing a JavaScript library like hightlight.js instead of pygments.

We've\ntaught numerous Python and Django trainings over the years under\n<a href=\"https://www.cartwheelweb.com/training/\">Cartwheel Web</a> , but this was\nthe first time we taught as <a href=\"https://www.twoscoopsacademy.com\">Two Scoops\nAcademy</a> using our new system of\ninstruction.</p>\n<p>The environment that the 91st Cyberspace Operations Squadron works in is\nheavily isolated from the internet. What this means is that until\ntechnology or information is approved, it is unavailable to the software\ndevelopers. While they can access Google, Stack Overflow, and Read the\nDocs, reading the source on GitHub is something they do at home, not on\nthe job. This means they really need to understand their material. Our\nexperience with their team (already competent in other programming\ntools) was that they were bright, focused, and willing to learn.</p>\n<p>The class included material on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python, PEP8, PEP20, object oriented programming</li>\n<li>Django and related best practices</li>\n<li>Class-based views, ModelForms, and Forms</li>\n<li>Using third-party Python/Django components</li>\n<li>Bootstrapping projects with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">Cookiecutter</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django\">Cookiecutter-Django</a></li>\n<li>PostgreSQL, pgAdmin III, and PyCharm's database tools</li>\n<li>PyCharm settings, debugging, testing, and coverage integration</li>\n<li>Bootstrap, SASS, CSS, and Grunt</li>\n<li>Simple and advanced version control workflows with Git</li>\n<li>APIs with Django REST Framework</li>\n<li>Django project deployment with Docker</li>\n<li>Custom material as requested by the US Air Force</li>\n<li>Much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We readily admit taking our course material is like receiving a firehose\nof knowledge to the face; that large portions probably won't make sense\nfor months. Yet as always with smart students, we could tell that the\ncore concepts of our curriculum were sticking.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon of the last day we switched to \"project\" mode,\nwhere the class breaks up into small teams to begin trying to resolve\nvarious in-house challenges. To our delight, challenges were completed\nand real progress was made. As instructors, nothing is more exciting\nthan seeing your students succeed.</p>\n<p>The class ended on a high note, but as always I'm sad that it's over.\nOur host, Captain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jondelmil\">Jonathan D. Miller</a>,\nwas gracious and accommodating. The students were friendly and willing\nto learn. I'm grateful to have taught them on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lackland_Air_Force_Base\">Lackland Air Force\nBase</a>, and I look\nforward to hearing about their successes in the future.</p>\n<p>For more details, see Audrey's <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com2015/11/intensive-django-training-with-91st.html\">blog\npost</a>.</p>\n<h1>Testimonial by Captain Jonathan D. Miller</h1>\n<p>Here are some kind words that we received about the training we\nprovided:</p>\n<p>Daniel and Audrey just ran the most effective, focused training course I've had the pleasure of attending. They worked tirelessly with me in the months leading up to the course so that it was tailored specifically for our squadron's development environment, and they followed up afterward to ensure that their slides were flawless for our continued reference.</p>\n<p>At several points during the course, my developers took me aside to mention to me how impressed they were with the Greenfelds' quality of instruction, preparation, and attention to detail. Having two instructors was a true force multiplier -- we covered more ground on Python and Django than I thought possible. After four days we were already building working prototypes of our desired applications, and many in the class had never touched Python before!</p>\n<p>Our squadron's return on investment for this course was remarkable. Daniel and Audrey have my strongest endorsement, and I know the 91st COS will be sending future developers.\n| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jondelmil\">Jonathan D.

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"/images/aliens.png\"><img src=\"/images/aliens.png\" alt=\"Aliens\"></a></p>\n<p>Unlike every other programming language I've used before, Python does\nnot have a switch or case statement. To get around this fact, we use\ndictionary mapping:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def numbers_to_strings(argument):\n    switcher = {\n        0: \"zero\",\n        1: \"one\",\n        2: \"two\",\n    }\n    return switcher.get(argument, \"nothing\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code is analogous to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function(argument){\n    switch(argument) {\n        case 0:\n            return \"zero\";\n        case 1:\n            return \"one\";\n        case 2:\n            return \"two\";\n        default:\n            return \"nothing\";\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>While the Python code is often more terse than the standard method of\nhandling cases, I could argue it is more arcane. When I first started\nPython it felt weird and distracting. Over time it grew on me, the use\nof a dictionary key being the identifier in a switch becoming more and\nmore habitual.</p>\n<h1>Dictionary Mapping for Functions</h1>\n<p>In Python we can also include functions or lambdas in our dictionary\nmapping:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def zero():\n    return \"zero\"\n\ndef one():\n    return \"one\"\n\ndef numbers_to_functions_to_strings(argument):\n    switcher = {\n        0: zero,\n        1: one,\n        2: lambda: \"two\",\n    }\n    # Get the function from switcher dictionary\n    func = switcher.get(argument, lambda: \"nothing\")\n    # Execute the function\n    return func()\n</code></pre>\n<p>While the code inside <code>zero()</code> and <code>one</code> are simple, many Python\nprograms use dictionary mappings like this to dispatch complex\nprocedures.</p>\n<h1>Dispatch Methods for Classes</h1>\n<p>If we don't know what method to call on a class, we can use a dispatch\nmethod to determine it at runtime.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Switcher(object):\n    def numbers_to_methods_to_strings(self, argument):\n        \"\"\"Dispatch method\"\"\"\n        # prefix the method_name with 'number_' because method names\n        # cannot begin with an integer.\n        method_name = 'number_' + str(argument)\n        # Get the method from 'self'. Default to a lambda.\n        method = getattr(self, method_name, lambda: \"nothing\")\n        # Call the method as we return it\n        return method()\n\n    def number_0(self):\n        return \"zero\"\n\n    def number_1(self):\n        return \"one\"\n\n    def number_2(self):\n        return \"two\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pretty nifty, right?</p>\n<h1>The Official Answer</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#why-isn-t-there-a-switch-or-case-statement-in-python\">official\nanswer</a>\nsays, \"You can do this easily enough with a sequence of\n<code>if... elif... elif... else</code>\". And that you can use dictionary mapping\nfor functions and dispatch methods for classes.</p>\n<p>Arguably the official answer doesn't explain anything except for\nworkarounds. In other words, a \"non-answer\". In my opinion, what the\nofficial answer is really trying to say is, \"Python doesn't need a\ncase statement.\"</p>\n<h1>Really?</h1>\n<p>Yup. But there's more. I've heard people I respect say that\nswitch/case statements in code can be really hard to debug.</p>\n<p>Personally I find that argument breaks down as soon as you run into\ngigantic nested dictionaries used for mapping of code branches. Think\nabout it, a 100+ element nested dictionary is just as hard to debug as a\nnested switch and case block with 100+ cases.</p>\n<h1>Maybe Dictionary Mapping Runs Faster?</h1>\n<p>Moot as Python doesn't have a case statement. Talking about benchmarks\nfrom other languages is pointless as what is faster in one language is\nnot always faster in another. Let's move on.</p>\n<h1>The Significant Advantage of Python's Approach</h1>\n<p>Every once in a while I walk into a scenario where Python's approach\njust works better than a switch/case statement. This is when at runtime\nI need to add or remove potential items from the mapping. When this\noccurs, my years of practice of writing dictionary mappings and dispatch\nmethods pays off. I have insights now that I never had back in the day\nwhen I relied on switch/case statements.</p>\n<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>\n<p>To me, that Python forced me to accumulate lots of practical experience\nwith mappings is a blessing in disguise. The constraint of not having\nswitch/case statements allowed me to create approaches and ideas I may\nnot have developed with it.</p>\n<p>Intentional or not, Python's lack of switch/case has been a social\nconstruct that made me a better coder.</p>\n<p>Enough so that I think this accidental social construct is a better\nanswer than the official one of 'Do this instead!'</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The reference book I co-authored with <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy\nGreenfeld</a> on Django best practices,\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8\">Two Scoops of Django\n1.8</a>, is\nnow available in both print paperback and PDF formats.</p>\n",

Working with lists in HTML becomes tedious quickly.\nWhich is why so many people use\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\">WYSIWYG</a> tools or mark up\nlanguages like <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>, as it expedites\ncreation of lists (and many other things).</p>\n<h1>reStructuredText</h1>\n<p>This blog is written in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText\">reStructuredText</a> and\ntransformed into <strong>HTML</strong>. Let's see the markup for this blog post:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rest\">* Item A\n* Item B\n\n  #. First Numbered Inner Item\n  #. Second Numbered Inner Item\n\n* Item C\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the extra lines between bullets and numbers? A behavior of\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that you have to put those in nested lists in\norder to make things display correctly. Also, 2 spaces indentation\ngenerates a different result than 4 spaces, the former creating\nsub-bullets, the latter creating an indented block quote with bullets.\nThey are there to remove ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, I did not know this until the day after I wrote\nthis article. Since understanding these behaviors can be challenging,\nmyself and Eric Holscher of <a href=\"https://readthedocs.org\">ReadTheDocs</a> fame\nbegan a project last year to <a href=\"https://restructuredtext.readthedocs.org/\">clearly index and\ndocument</a> all the details of\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong> from the user's point of view. Our plan was to\nprovide this as an adjunct to the <a href=\"https://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/\">formal\ndocumentation</a> of\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong>. Alas, time and work considerations got in the way.\nIf you want to help expand our effort, you can contribute at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext\">https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing to note about <strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that it's pretty much\nPython only. Outside the Python world if you are writing plaintext\nmarkup then odds are you are using <strong>Markdown</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Markdown</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a> does lists really\nwell. Terse and no weird quirks:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">- Item A\n- Item B\n  1. First Numbered Inner Item\n  1. Second Numbered Inner Item\n- Item C\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another nice feature about <strong>Markdown</strong> is that it's in use everywhere.\nGitHub, Stack Overflow, my favorite tablet writing app, and a lot more.</p>\n<h1>Markdown vs. reStructuredText</h1>\n<p>Why don't I switch from <strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>? Here are\nmy reasons against switching:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Force of habit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi\">PyPI</a> requires it to display package\nlong descriptions nicely on Package pages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)\">Sphinx</a>\nis based on it.</li>\n<li><strong>reStructuredText</strong> has one concrete standard, with extensions that\npeople add. Markdown has many standards, which may or may not have\nshared features.</li>\n<li>I can use <a href=\"https://pandoc.org\">Pandoc</a> to help transform\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>LaTeX</h1>\n<p>Finally, let's discuss <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">LaTeX</a>.\nWhile not a markup language it bears mentioning, and I'll explain why\nlater in this section.</p>\n<p>Up to about 8-10 years ago <strong>LaTeX</strong> was used in a lot of technical\nwriting, including the Python core documentation. That ended with the\nrise of mark up languages, relegating <strong>LaTeX</strong> to the world of\nacademics, mathematicians and computer scientists - anywhere complex\nequations need to be specified.</p>\n<p>LaTeX belongs in this article because it is so commonly used with\nmarkup. In fact, as far as I can tell, in order to render\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> content into the PDF format, the\nmost common approach is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a script to transform the markup into <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</li>\n<li>Use a tool like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX\">XeTeX</a> to\nrender the <strong>LaTeX</strong> into PDF.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why the extra step? Why not just go directly from markup to PDF? Well,\nthe content in <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> have to be\nformatted in order for them to be displayed, or they will just look like\nplaintext markup. When they are converted to <strong>HTML</strong>, the browser does\nthe formatting for us. When they are translated to PDF, LaTeX is a very\ncommon choice. That is because <strong>LaTeX</strong> isn't a markup language, but a\ntypesetting tool. Unlike <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> which are\ndesigned for ease of use, <strong>LaTeX</strong> is designed to make documents look\ngood.</p>\n<p>Here is how I define my sample list in <strong>LaTeX</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-latex\">\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Item A\n    \\item Item A\n        \\begin{enumerate}\n            \\item First Numbered Inner Item\n            \\item Second Numbered Inner Item\n        \\end{enumerate}\n    \\item Item C\n\\end{itemize}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Halfway between the markup languages and HTML in verbosity, <strong>LaTeX</strong>\nlists are of medium difficulty to write. If this example makes <strong>LaTeX</strong>\nlook easy, please realize that while lists are easy to understand, other\nstructures like <strong>LaTeX</strong>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables\">tables</a> can quickly get out\nof hand. <strong>LaTeX</strong>'s reputation for being an arcane tool is a well\ndeserved one.</p>\n<h1>Modifying Generated LaTeX</h1>\n<p>Several book authors, including ourselves, have written books using\n<strong>reStructuredText</strong> or <strong>Markdown</strong>, generated the <strong>LaTeX</strong>, then\nmodified the <strong>LaTeX</strong> before rendering the PDF. The approach is\nseductive: You get the ease of a markup language combined with the\nformatting precision of <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>\n<p>Or do you?</p>\n<p>The problem my wife and I have faced is that the combination of\n<strong>LaTeX</strong> packages and tools we've assembled for ourselves to write\nbooks like <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8\">Two Scoops of\nDjango</a> is\nvery, very different than what is rendered via\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils\">docutils</a>' <code>rst2latex</code> or\nSphinx <code>make latex</code>. We've tried to write migration scripts, but have\nfound that we end up spending too much of our time on formatting.\nThat's why we have stuck with hand-crafted artisan <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>\n<p>That isn't to say it isn't possible. In fact, Matt Harrison has\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Introduction-Python-Testing-Harrison-ebook/dp/B00AY4VE8E/?tag=mlinar-20\">released</a>\na number\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Learning-Iteration-Generators-Python/dp/1492333514/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mlinar-20\">handsome</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-1-Foundations/dp/1475266413/ref=sr_1_2?tag=mlinar-20\">Python</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-2-Intermediate/dp/149055095X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20\">books</a>\nfollowing this path (<strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>LaTeX</strong>). I'm certain\nthere are <strong>Markdown</strong> books that follow this path too.</p>\n<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>\n<p>For better or for worse, lists of bullets and numbers are a foundation\nof how we communicate via the written medium. They allow for terse\ncommunication of ideas and thought, but that same terseness can mean we\nskip over details. Interestingly enough, the very tools that we use to\ncreate lists can color our ability and desire to use them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update 2015/05/14 - Added note about closing <code>&#x3C;/li></code> tags thanks to\nIvan Sagalaev.</li>\n<li>Update 2015/05/14 - Made Markdown list more cross-compatible thanks\nto Tzu-ping Chung.</li>\n<li>Update 2015/05/14 - Fixed LaTeX list definition thanks to Mark van\nLent.</li>\n<li>Update 2015/05/15 - Explained the behaviors of <strong>reStructuredText</strong>\nthanks to David Goodger.</li>\n</ul>\n",

If you are using the site's\nAPIs in any way, this affects you.</p>\n<p>This site, maintained by myself and <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy\nGreenfeld</a>, is the directory of reusable\napps, sites, and tools for Django-powered projects. And the site has\nbeen running on Django 1.4.x for about 2.5 years. Which in internet\nyears is forever. It's time to upgrade!</p>\n<p>Alas, we have a problem.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The first REST API for the project, APIv1 is running on a very old\nversion of\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie/0.9.7\">django-tastypie</a>\n(0.9.7) which blocks upgrading the Django version, even to Django 1.5.\nWhile we could do a lot of work to migrate upwards to modern\ndjango-tastypie, that would require a lot of time that we would rather\nspend adding new features or making other stuff. More importantly, there\nare elements to the APIv1's design that we want to change.</p>\n<p>While we are on the subject of legacy APIs, the second REST API for the\nproject, the mostly undocumented APIv2, is powered by a relatively old\nversion of <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/2.3.8\">Django Rest\nFramework</a>\n(2.3.8). The design of APIv2 was a bit of an experiement in\narchitectural design, one whose novel approach (API views mixed into\nstandard HTML views instead of seperated out) was unweildy and\nultimately annoying. One might even call it an anti-pattern. That's\nfine, as sometimes you have to try things in order to determine better\napproaches for later, but it's time for this version of the API to die.</p>\n<p>Our eventual goal is to get Django Packages running on Django 1.8 as\nwell as implementing a brand-new REST API powered by Django Rest\nFramework. Getting there is the trick. Hence, we've created \"<strong>The\nPlan</strong>\".</p>\n<h2>The Plan</h2>\n<p>We have a four-stage plan for migrating the site upwards:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On April 2, 2015 we will be turning off APIv1. All endpoints will\nredirect to APIv3.</li>\n<li>On April 3, 2015, we will be turning off APIv2. All endpoints will\nstop working.</li>\n<li>On April 4, we commence work on migrating the project to Django 1.8.</li>\n<li>Whenever we finish #3, we start work on APIv4, powered by Django\nRest Framework.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>About APIv3</h3>\n<p>Already implemented, this version of the API is powered by very simple\nJSON-powered views. Since both APIv1 and APIv2 only have GET endpoints,\nit was easy to roll something out that provided nearly all the data\ngenerated by both previous APIs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://djangopackages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/apiv3_docs.html\">Django Packages APIv3\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.djangopackages.com/api/v3/\">Django Packages APIv3\nEndpoint</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Update 2014/03/01</strong>: Clarified the design mistake of APIv2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.djangopackages.org/\"><img src=\"/images/logo_501x316.png\" alt=\"Django Packages logo\"></a></p>\n",

It's something on the line of \"<em>What the\nheck?!?</em>\"</p>\n<p>It means that if you want to give a talk, you don't need to be an\nexpert. We don't have an formal, extensive review process. It's a\nchance to share ideas and learn something new. You can be just a Django\nhobbyist instead of a professional. All you have to be is\n<strong>passionate</strong>.</p>\n<p>At the event, we'll put up a board with slots for talks. Attendees can\nput themselves into these slots for talks. This makes for a fun, fluid\nevent where new speakers are as welcome as experienced speakers.</p>\n<p>While this is meant to be an informal, beginner-friendly event, a\nprofessional level of conduct is still required:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speakers, like all attendees must agree to the code of\nconduct (listed on the <a href=\"https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com\">event page</a>).</li>\n<li>No sales or recruiting pitches. Don't even try it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some attendees planning to be speakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonw\">Simon Willison</a> (co-founder of Django,\nco-founder of <a href=\"https://lanyrd.com/\">Lanyrd</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin\">Andrew Godwin</a> (South,\nMigrations, etc)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/natbat\">Natalie Downe</a> (co-founder of\n<a href=\"https://lanyrd.com/\">Lanyrd</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a>\n(<a href=\"github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">Cookiecutter</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/messagebar\">MessageBar</a>, <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6\">Two Scoops of\nDjango</a>)</li>\n<li>Michael Herman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realpython\">Real Python</a>)</li>\n<li>Myself</li>\n<li>You!

(see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Camping!</h3>\n<p>On the night of October 4th, you can stay overnight at <a href=\"https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com\">BarCamp Django\nSF</a>!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com\">BarCamp Django SF</a> is 2 days,\nand will run from 10am Saturday morning until 4pm Sunday in the\n<a href=\"https://eventbrite.com\">Eventbrite</a> San Francisco office. Doors will be\nopen throughout the duration of the event and all are welcome to camp\nout overnight. If you do plan on camping, you'll need to <strong>bring your\nown sleeping bag, blow up beds, pillows &#x26; blankets</strong>.</p>\n<p>What's really awesome about camping at <a href=\"https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com\">BarCamp Django\nSF</a> is it allows out-of-town\nattendees to keep their costs low ($15 event cost vs $200+ hotel\nrooms).</p>\n<p><strong>note:</strong> Our definition of 'camping' is staying overnight inside the\nEventbrite office in San Francisco. While you can't pitch a tent, you\ndon't have to worry about mosquitoes. Some people will stay up all\nnight, but we'll have quiet areas for those of us who need our 8 hours.</p>\n<p>See you there!</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2014/09/13:</strong> Added note that explains speaking is not\nmandatory.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>In Python, the <code>@cached_property</code> decorator is a really nice piece of\ncode. What it does is it caches the result of a\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property\">property</a>\ncall. The cached result will persist as long as the instance does, so if\nthe instance is passed around and the function subsequently invoked, the\ncached result will be returned.</p>\n<p>If that doesn't make much sense, below is a snippet of code that shows\nthe code and demonstrates it in action. As always, I'm using\n<a href=\"/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html\">pytest</a> to\nvalidate my code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport time\n\nclass cached_property(object):\n    \"\"\" A property that is only computed once per instance and then replaces\n        itself with an ordinary attribute.

Pretty neat, yeah!</p>\n<p>While originally implemented for web frameworks such as Django, Flask,\nPyramid, and Bottle, I've copy/pasted the <code>cached_property</code> property\nfrom non-web project to project as a quick way to give my code a little\nboost. I got tired of doing this, and on May 17th, 2014 I decided to\nrelease it as a package called cached-property on\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cached-property\">PyPI</a>. Using it is easy:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># assuming you've already done \"pip install cached-property\"\nfrom cached_property import cached_property\n\nclass SlowClass2(object):\n\n    @cached_property\n    def very_slow(self):\n        \"\"\"Represents a performance heavy property.\"\"\"\n        time.sleep(1)  # Wait a WHOLE second!\n        return \"I am slooooow\"\n\ndef test_slow_class2():\n    # Instantiate the slow class\n    slow_class = SlowClass2()\n\n    # Start the clock!\n    start = datetime.now()\n\n    # Call the property. This time it's really slow...\n    assert slow_class.very_slow == \"I am slooooow\"\n\n    # Check that it took at least a second to run\n    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1000) >= start - datetime.now()\n\n    # Call the property a second time. This time it runs fast.\n    assert slow_class.very_slow == \"I am slooooow\"\n\n    # Second time running, should take a TINY amount of time.\n    # Should take just a microsecond, but we'll play a test for and test\n    #   for a maximim of at least 100 milliseconds.\n    assert timedelta(milliseconds=1100) > start - datetime.now()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hooray! No more copy/pasting for me! I was very pleased with myself.</p>\n<p>Little did I know how fortunate I was for having released this package.</p>\n<h1>Don't Copy/Paste Code</h1>\n<p>The very next day after I released the cached-property package, <a href=\"https://github.com/Tinche\">Tin\nTvrtković</a> opened an issue asking for <a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/issues/6\">better\nmultithreaded\nsupport</a>. To my\nshock and embarressment, my copy/pasted code could have been disastrous\nif brought into the wrong project. I had blindly been assuming that the\ncode I hadn't bothered to try and understand worked under any\nsituation, when in reality it had been designed for working within the\ncontext of a web framework.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Tin <a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/pull/9\">submitted a pull\nrequest</a>, and now the\n<code>cached-property</code> package also includes a <code>@threaded_cached_property</code>\ndecorator. Thank you Tin!</p>\n<p>However, the lessons of the experience had been burned into my brain.</p>\n<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Don't copy/paste code blindly from project to project.</li>\n<li>If you are repeatedly moving code from project to project, take the\ntime to understand what the code is actually doing.</li>\n<li>Instead of copy/pasting code from project to project, make a package\nand ask for input from others. If making a package feels like too\nmuch work,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>\nmakes creating new packages really easy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Going forward</h1>\n<p>One exciting development has been the <a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/issues/2\">discussion to include a\ncached_property decorator in core\nPython</a>. Even if my\ncontribution to the effort has been merely the encapsulation of the\ncode, it's nice to know I may have some small part in the development\nof the language.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/directions_med.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n",

Even though the URL\nis old, the content is new.</p>\n<p>New to Python and/or conferences and attending the upcoming <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/\">PyCon\n2015</a> in Montreal, Canada? Or is this your\nfirst conference? Or perhaps your first conference longer than a\nweekend?</p>\n<p>Hoping to get the most out of joining thousands of Python enthusiasts?</p>\n<p>No worries! This guide will aid you in attending one of the best\ntechnical conferences on the planet. Even though I'm not attending on\naccount of various reasons including finances, work, and personal\nprojects, I'm going to share how to get through duration of pycon in\ngood shape. I'm also going to share some great tricks to optimize the\nevent.</p>\n<h1>Basics</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>\n<li>Bring something to take notes. A paper notebook, laptop, or tablet.\nAnything!</li>\n<li>If you are looking for work, bring business cards. Seriously.</li>\n<li>At every meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) make a point of sitting\nwith or going out with different people. Introduce yourself. Make\nnew friends and learn new things!</li>\n<li>If you can't make it to a talk, don't stress out. They are\nrecorded and will be available later on <a href=\"https://www.pyvideo.org\">https://www.pyvideo.org</a>.</li>\n<li>Act Professionally (see next section)</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Be Professional</h1>\n<p>PyCon is a professional event. Sure, lots of people are in t-shirts and\nare having fun, often in oddly goofy ways. Yet stepping outside the\nboundaries of civilized behavior is not acceptable. Keep in mind that\nPyCon US has a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/\">code of\nconduct</a>. Whether or\nnot you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one\nand it will be enforced.</p>\n<h1>Get to the Registration Desk Early</h1>\n<p>As the lines for registration can get epic, I like to get my badge as\nearly as possible so I don't miss PyCon's famously incredible keynote\nspeeches.</p>\n<h1>Must-See Tutorials</h1>\n<p>All of the beginner tutorials at\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/\">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/</a> look wonderful. You\nsimply can't go wrong with any of them.</p>\n<h1>Must-See Talks</h1>\n<p>All of them.</p>\n<p>I'm actually a little relieved that I'm not going to PyCon, because\nthere were some time slots thad several must-see talks running\nconcurrently. I would have to clone myself repeatedly in order to see\nall the good stuff! Fortunately, I'll be able to watch them on\n<a href=\"https://www.pyvideo.org\">https://www.pyvideo.org</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are new to open source and plan to attend the PyCon 2015 sprints\n(or in general contribute to open source), then I strongly recommend\nShauna Gordon-McKeon's \"Open Source for Newcomers and the People Who\nWant to Welcome Them\" talk (description at\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/\">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/</a>). She's the\nprogram director of Open Hatch, a group focused on bringing more people\ninto the open source community.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: For the talks you are excited about attending, get there\nearly. If you really want to attend a particular talk, odds are so does\neveryone else and the room might be packed. Don't be forced to sit on\nthe floor or stand outside the door. Show up early!</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/\">https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/</a> for the talk schedules.</p>\n<h1>Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>\n<p>At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and\nbrightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some\nquick guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions at the\nend, <a href=\"https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/\">go and\nask</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's disconcerting to\ngive a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable\nelectronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using\nelectronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning\nthem off to look at the speaker.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of\nhundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video.\nHeckling is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and\nmake enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the\ntalk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Lunches</h1>\n<p>Don't forget to keep whatever they hand out to track meals at the\nregistration desk or you might not be able to get your food.</p>\n<p>Try and sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every\ntime I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to\nmeet amazing people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never\nget to know any of them unless you try.</p>\n<h1>Sprints</h1>\n<p>When the tutorials and talks are over, the sprints begin. These are like\nhackathons, but for only open source efforts. Imagine the chance to\napply everything you just learn, while sitting amongst other Python\nenthusiast including dozens of projects leaders. Not only do you get the\nchance to apply what you've just learned, you can contribute to make\nthe world of Python better!</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/\">https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/</a> for general sprint\ninformation.</p>\n<h2>Sprint Requirements</h2>\n<p>For beginners setting up a Python development environment can be tricky.\nIf the list below looks intimidating, look for any sprints with\n\"beginner\" in the title. There is always something! While they aren't\nlisted yet, but there should be something up within a week or two.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want a pre-PyCon challenge, I recommend\ngetting the the following installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Modern versions of Python:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2.7 (mandatory)</li>\n<li>Python 3.4 (Rather mandatory for Python 3 work)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be ready with source control. You should have installed and possess\nworking knowledge with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Git. Really make sure you have a GitHub account</li>\n<li>Mercurial. Useful to have a BitBucket account.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html\">virtualenv</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html\">pip</a> for\nall versions of Python. If you are using Python 3.4, you don't need\nto have them installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An IDE or Text Editor you are comfortable using.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Staying Healthy Over Nine Days of Python!</h1>\n<p>If you attend the tutorials, talks and sprints, that's <strong>nine days</strong>.\nYou (or your organization) are putting out some serious money for you to\ngo and discover new knowledge, new people, or a bunch of other reasons.\nThe last thing you want to do is end up sick for part or all of the\nconference.</p>\n<p>Odds are you'll be riding in public transit (planes, trains, buses) to\nget there. Unfortunately, you'll be travelling with people who are\nsick. Then, for over a week, you'll be around thousands of people who\nhave travelled under similar conditions. Many of those people, possibly\nyourself, will be eating poorly, drinking heavily, and not getting\nenough sleep.</p>\n<p>Here are some things I've found work wonders to keep me active and\nalert and I recommend you do the same <strong>every</strong> day of the conference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>\n<li>Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different\npeople at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!</li>\n<li>Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your\nbrain is going to go into learning overdrive. I aim for 6-8 hours.</li>\n<li>Bring <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Airborne-Support-Supplement-Vitamin-Effervescent/dp/B000WZI4WY?tag=mlinar-20\">Immune System\nBoosters</a>\nand consume them daily. I usually do it with breakfast and lunch.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Get Autographs!</h1>\n<p>As an author, I can't recommend enough that you bring your favorite\nprogramming book and get it autographed. A few books I want to get\nsigned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449340377/?tag=cn-001-20\">Python Cookbook, by David Beazley and Brian\nJones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793/?tag=cn-001-20\">Python for Data Analysis, by Wes\nMcKinney</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications/dp/1449372627/?tag=cn-001-20\">Flask Web Development, by Miguel\nGrinberg</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Harry-Percival/dp/1449364829/?tag=cn-001-20\">Test-Driven Development with Python, by Harry\nPercival</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Two Scoops of Django Footnote</h1>\n<p>Keep your eyes open.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>A year ago today <a href=\"https://about.me/malcolmt\">Malcolm Tredinnick</a>, core\ncontributor to Django suddenly passed away. He was a mentor, and more\nimportantly, a good friend.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my memories of Malcolm.</p>\n<h1>DjangoCon US: September 2010</h1>\n<p>This is where Audrey and I first met Malcolm. We ended up spending a\ngood amount of the conference with him just hanging out and having a\ngood time. I remember being honored that such a luminary wanted to spend\ntime with us, yet was more delighted in discovering a good friend.</p>\n<p>During the conference, he peered into the nascent code base of\n<a href=\"https://www.djangopackages.com\">djangopackages.com</a> and asked some\npointed questions. We justified a few design decisions, and he agreed,\nand we saw him using similar techniques later. He gave us some great\npointers on things we could do, and I believe we implemented all of\nthem.</p>\n<h1>Summer to Autumn of 2010</h1>\n<p>Malcolm and I worked together on a project in 2010. During this time we\nhad a number of email and chat discussions. Going over them now I'm\nimpressed by his friendship and generosity of knowledge. I know he was\nterribly busy but yet he always had time for me in 2010.</p>\n<p>After about 15 emails where I addressed him as 'Malcom', Malcolm\nfinally got me to consistently spell his name correctly with a single\nsentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might be amazed at how cranky it makes me when people try to spell\nMalcolm with only one \"l\".</p>\n<p>:-)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was Malcolm: Acerbic yet tempered with a smile.</p>\n<h1>PyCon Australia: August 2011</h1>\n<p>We had just arrived in Sydney. Our first overseas trip together! Audrey\nwas giving the opening keynote at PyCon Australia. She wanted to\npractice her speech but I was restless. So she suggested that I go out\nfor dinner, specifically sushi train with Malcolm Tredinnick and Russell\nKeith-Magee. I don't remember anything about the food, but I do\nremember having a great time with good friends.</p>\n<p>After the conference one evening Audrey and I spent a few hours with\njust Malcolm walking around Sydney. None of us wanted it to end. The\ntime spent together outside of the insane pace of a conference was a\npoignant reminder that even with email, chat, and IRC, there was still\nthousands of miles between us.</p>\n<h1>PyCon Philippines: June 2012</h1>\n<p>On his own dollar, Malcolm had dropped everything to attend. He spoke,\nhe taught, and he made many friends. I have to admit being jealous of\nthe students in the Django tutorial he taught because they got to spend\ntime with him. ;)</p>\n<p>It was our last time with Malcolm, and it was so brief, so limited. I\nwas okay with that because I thought I would get a chance to see him\nagain.</p>\n<h1>Two Scoops of Django: October 2012-January 2013</h1>\n<p>If you read the\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/malcolm-tredinnick-memorial\">memorial</a>\nwe wrote for Malcolm, you can see that his presence is an integral part\nof Two Scoops of Django. He coached us, guided us, forced us to dig\ndeeper and deeper into source code. Of special note is the database\nchapter (excluding the 1.6 edition transactions), which he really\nfocused on.</p>\n<h1>Today: March 17th, 2014</h1>\n<p>What Matt Croydon says:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Celebrate the life of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malcolmt\">@malcolmt</a> today: be nice to someone, help someone learn something, and push some code.

We'll\nintroduce you to various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and\ntechniques that we've picked up over the years. We have put thousands\nof hours into writing and revising its hundreds of pages of concise,\nexample-packed text.</p>\n<h2>Why Should You Purchase the Second Edition?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I read the first edition cover to cover. The second one raises the\nbar again. It's pedagogical, entertaining, and thoughtful.\"</p>\n<p>-- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6\nReviewer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why should you buy this updated version of our previous book? Well,\nit's more than a slight rename, it's been\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list\">revised</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list\">expanded</a>!</p>\n<h2>It's Revised</h2>\n<p>Significant portions of the previous material have been revised,\nincorporating huge amounts of feedback submitted by our readers over the\npast year. We listened to suggestions, clarified existing content, and\nincorporated useful tips into the book, carefully curating what went in\nand what didn't. Our goal was to make the existing content even more\nsuccinct and worth reading.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I disagree with the idea that running tests on SQLite is OK, for the\nsame reasons developing on SQLite causes problems.\"</p>\n<p>-- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6\nReviewer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As with writing the previous edition, we asked numerous subject matter\nexperts on security, databases, deployment and more for their feedback\nand advice. We're not afraid to ask questions or to ask the best and\nbrightest to find fault with our work. It's hard to be told you're\nwrong by those who you respect, and even harder to change patterns you\npromoted. However, we believe it's our duty to the readers to make our\nbook the best is can be.</p>\n<h2>It's Expanded</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Can Two Scoops of Django expand the deployment chapter?\"</p>\n<p>-- Most frequently-asked request</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We had countless requests for more content from readers around the\nworld. People asked us to cover more and more stuff and we've done our\nbest to comply. We have new material on function-based views, Django\n1.6-era transactions, deployment, internationalization, Python 3,\nidentical environments, and more.</p>\n<p>In fact...</p>\n<h3>We expanded the book so much that <strong>3 > 4</strong>:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6\"><img src=\"/images/3vs4-M.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></a></p>\n<p>This isn't to say that we padded the book. Not at all. The new material\nis packed with our loud volume of code examples and concise\nexplanations. We would like to think it's awesome, but that's because\nwe had the whole world helping us put it together.</p>\n<h2>We Did It Together</h2>\n<p>I believe this new edition is amazing. As I said before, we didn't do\nit alone, we had you in our corner. By you, I mean the technical\nreviewers and readers giving us support and feedback. We did it for you,\nthe Python and Django developers around the world.</p>\n<p>Which means I'm delighted that our latest effort is finally in print.\nIn my perfect world it gets a thousand five star reviews. ;-)</p>\n<h2>Order!</h2>\n<p>You can purchase <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6\">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django\n1.6</a>\nonline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6\">Two Scoops\nPress</a>\n(autographed, limited supplies available)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/wholesale-two-scoops-of-django-best-practices-for-django-1-6\">Two Scoops Press Bulk\nOrder</a>\n(15 book minimum, free shipping anywhere on Earth)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1n98duC\">Amazon.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1jejegF\">Amazon.com UK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1lzGGH5\">Amazon.com Germany</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1nRB2Pa\">Amazon.com France</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1b0TeCV\">Amazon.com Spain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/1bsZCAT\">Amazon.com Italy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're also exploring distribution in Australia, Asia, and South\nAmerica.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>In my previous <a href=\"/awesome-slugify-human-readable-url-slugs-from-any-string.html\">blog\npost</a>\nI covered using\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awesome-slugify\">awesome-slugify</a> to\ncapture slugs in both ASCII and unicode. Today I'm covering the\ndefinition custom language <code>slugify</code> translation functions.</p>\n<h2>Defining Custom Language <code>slugify</code> Translation Functions</h2>\n<p>For those times we need ASCII representation of unicode characters, we\ncan't always use the default unicode-to-ASCII mappings. A powerful\nfeature of <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is we can quickly and easily create our\nown translation functions. Just follow these two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define a translation dictionary. Keys are the names of things you\nwant translated, and the associated values are what the keys are\ntranslated into.</li>\n<li>Generate a translation function using <code>slugify.main.get_slugify()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Explaining this in depth will take paragraphs of text, so I'll just\ndemonstrate it using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji\">emoji</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# test_slugify_emoji.py\n\nfrom slugify import get_slugify\nimport pytest\n\n# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary\nALT_EMOJI = {\n    u'ʘ‿ʘ': u'smiling',\n    u'ಠ_ಠ': u'disapproval',\n    u'♥‿♥': u'enamored',\n    u'♥': u'love',\n}\n\n# Step 2: Generate a translation function\nslugify_emoji = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_EMOJI)\n\ndef test_basic_emoji():\n    assert slugify_emoji(u\"ʘ‿ʘ\") == u\"smiling\"\n    assert slugify_emoji(u\"ಠ_ಠ\") == u\"disapproval\"\n\ndef test_sentence():\n    txt = u\"I ♥ Audrey Roy Greenfeld\"\n    assert slugify_emoji(txt) == u\"I-love-Audrey-Roy-Greenfeld\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pytest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/images/i-%E2%99%A5-your-unicode-smile.png\" alt=\"I ♥ your unicode smile\"></p>\n<h3>More Practical Applications</h3>\n<p>While writing an <strong>emoji</strong>-based translation function is fun, most of\nthe time we need more practical translation functions. Built into\n<strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is a cyrillic translation function that works like\nthis:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# test_slugify_cyrillic.py\nfrom slugify import get_slugify\nimport pytest\n\n# The following code is nearly identical to the source code of\n#   awesome-slugify. All credit goes to Dmitry Voronin.\n\n# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary\nALT_CYRILLIC = {\n    u'ё': u'e',    # instead of 'io' / 'yo'\n    u'ж': u'j',    # instead of 'zh'\n    u'у': u'y',    # instead of 'u'\n    u'х': u'h',    # instead of 'kh'\n    u'щ': u'sch',  # instead of 'shch'\n    u'ю': u'u',    # instead of 'iu' / 'yu'\n    u'я': u'ya',   # instead of 'ia'\n}\n\n# Step 2: Generate a translation function\nslugify_ru = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_CYRILLIC)\n\ndef test_some_cyrillic():\n    txt = u\"ж and я are really fun letters.\"\n    assert slugify_ru(txt) == u\"j-and-ya-are-really-fun-letters\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pytest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://bikeshedder.com/\">Michael P. Jung</a> created a German translation\nfunction, which I've included below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# test_slugify_german.py\nfrom slugify import get_slugify\nimport pytest\n\n# Step 1: Define the translation dictionary\nALT_GERMAN = {\n    u'ä': u'ae',\n    u'Ä': u'Ae',\n    u'ö': u'oe',\n    u'Ö': u'Oe',\n    u'ü': u'ue',\n    u'Ü': u'Ue'\n}\n\n# Step 2: Generate a translation function\nslugify_de = get_slugify(pretranslate=ALT_GERMAN)\n\ndef test_german_dumpling():\n    # According to Michael P. Jung, this looks like ice cream.\n    assert slugify_de(u'Thüringer Klöße') == u\"Thueringer-Kloesse\"\n\ndef test_german_road():\n    txt = u\"I've never been in a car on a German straße\"\n    assert slugify_de(txt) == u\"Ive-never-been-in-a-car-on-a-German-strasse\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pytest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I really like the flexibility and power of <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>. During\nslugification it provides functions to preserve unicode characters,\nconvert unicode characters to ASCII, and even define new translation\nfunctions. As <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> is a relatively new project, there are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dimka665/awesome-slugify/issues\">a few issues</a>, but\nmost of those are for my quirky edge cases (such as when trying to use\nparenthesis in translation dictionaries for\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons\">emoticons</a>) or perhaps stem\nfrom my poor understanding of how unicode-to-ASCII functions.</p>\n<p>In any case, this is a very useful package.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2013/01/23</strong> Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/dimka665\">Dmitry\nVoronin</a>, I removed references to a couple\nissues with <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>. It no longer forces capitalization in\ncustom translation functions and the <code>get_slugify()</code> can be imported\ndirectly from the base <code>slugify</code> package.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><em>note: The introduction mentions Django and Plone. However, this is not\nan article about Django or Plone.</em></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Years ago, when I was working with <a href=\"https://plone.org\">Plone</a> at\n<a href=\"https://nasa.gov\">NASA</a>, one thing I dreaded was when content editors\nwould copy-and-paste from Microsoft Word into the title bar. All kinds\nof funny characters would appear in the title bar and URL. I would have\nto go into the database (ZODB) and fix things. Things didn't get better\nuntil <a href=\"https://github.com/reedobrien\">Reed O'Brien</a> turned on a title\nvalidator (probably in <code>Plone.i18n</code>).</p>\n<p>When we started using <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com\">Django</a>, one thing\nthat made it nice was the presence of it's\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/utils/#module-django.utils.text\">slugify()</a>\nfunction and template filter. Inspired by the newspaper industry, this\nfunction it easier on both content editors and software engineers. In\nany case, using <code>slugify()</code> we completed a number of projects, with\n<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/\">NASA Science</a> being the only public one I\nworked on.</p>\n<p>As much as the <code>slugify()</code> function was useful, there were problems. As\nI discovered time and time again over the years, it didn't handle\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode\">unicode</a>. Or rather, it handled\nthem by simply vanishing non-ASCII unicode characters. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from django.utils.text import slugify\n>>> slugify(u\"straße\") # German for road\nu\"strae\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you read German, you'll know that the default Django <code>slugify()</code>\nfunction is converting the word 'road' to nonsense. For sites dealing\nwith internationalization, this won't do. So over three years ago while\nat <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"https://pinterest.com\">Pinterest</a>\nengineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davedash\">Dave Dash</a> created\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-slugify\">unicode-slugify</a>. From\nthen on we could do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from slugify import slugify\n>>> slugify(u\"straße\") # Again with the German word for road\nu\"straße\"\n</code></pre>\n<h3>What If I'm Not Using Django?</h3>\n<p>While a very nice tool, this package is dependent on Django's internal\nmachinery to operate, which is a problem for non-Django users. While we\ncould use Python's <a href=\"https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/5/\">unicodedata library to resolve unicode to\nslugs</a>, wouldn't it be nice if\nthere was a nicely packaged/tested solution?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, such a nicely packaged/tested solution exists, and it's\nawesome!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/awesome_slugify_django.jpg\" alt=\"An Awesome Django slug\"></p>\n<h2>Introducing awesome-slugify</h2>\n<p>Created and maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/dimka665\">Dmitry Voronin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awesome-slugify\">awesome-slugify</a> is easy\nto use and <strong>100% independent from Django</strong>. You call it thus:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> import slugify\n>>> slugify.slugify(u\"straße\") # Yet again the German for road\nu'strasse'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Works! Hooray!</p>\n<p>However, please note that unlike the Django-only <strong>unicode-slugify</strong>\npackage which preserves the non-ASCII characters, <strong>awesome-slugify</strong>\ntransformed the German 'ß' into an ASCII substitution of 'ss'. This\nis similar to how the popular\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-slugify\">python-slugify</a> package\nworks. While this behavior of translating unicode to ASCII might work\nfor English-only sites, it's not so useful for the rest of the world.\nFortunately, <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> also provides the incredibly useful\n<code>slugify_unicode()</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> import slugify\n>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u\"straße\") # What is it with German Roads?\nu'stra\\xdfe'\n>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u\"straße\") == u\"straße\"\nTrue\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Using awesome-slugify</h3>\n<p>Rather than describe <strong>awesome-slugify</strong> in paragraph format, here is\nworking test code (<a href=\"/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html\">using pytest which I described\nbefore</a>) that\nexplains what we can do:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# test_awesome_slugify.py\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nimport pytest\nfrom slugify import slugify, slugify_unicode\n\ndef test_simple():\n    txt = \"This is basic functionality!!!    \"\n    assert slugify(txt) == \"This-is-basic-functionality\"\n\ndef test_remove_special_characters():\n    txt = \"special characters (#?@$%^&#x26;*) are also ASCII\"\n    assert slugify(txt) == \"special-characters-are-also-ASCII\"\n\ndef test_basic_accents_and_backslash_escapes():\n    txt = 'Where I've gone before'\n    assert slugify(txt) == \"Where-Ive-gone-before\"\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef accents():\n    return u'Àddîñg áçćèńtš tô Éñgłïśh íš śīłłÿ!'\n\ndef test_accents(accents):\n    assert slugify(accents) == \"Adding-accents-to-English-is-silly\"\n\ndef test_keep_accents(accents):\n    assert slugify_unicode(accents) == \\\n                        'Àddîñg-áçćèńtš-tô-Éñgłïśh-íš-śīłłÿ'\n\ndef test_keep_accents_lower(accents):\n    # Because awesome-slugify doesn't lower() while slugify, we\n    #   have to do it ourselves.

            "content_html": "<p>In my previous <a href=\"/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-2.html\">blog\npost</a> I\ncovered writing exception-based assertions and fixtures. Today I'm\ngoing to close things out by demonstrating how to change the behavior of\n<a href=\"https://pytest.org/\">pytest</a> and how to integrate it with <strong>Django</strong> and\n<code>setup.py</code>.</p>\n<h1>Changing the Behavior of <strong>pytest</strong></h1>\n<p>When <strong>pytest</strong> is called, either via the command-line or by\n<code>pytest.main()</code>, it <a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/customize.html#how-test-configuration-is-read-from-configuration-ini-files\">looks for a configuration\nfile</a>\ncalled either <code>pytest.ini</code>, <code>tox.ini</code>, and <code>setup.cfg</code>. If it finds a\nconfiguration file, it follows standard practices for those things. In\nthe following example, I demonstrating searching for tests inside of all\nPython files while ignoring the <code>**_build**</code> directories:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ini\"># pytest.ini (or tox.ini or setup.cfg)\n[pytest] # You must put pytest-related controls in a 'pytest' block\npython_files=*.py  # Run tests against all python modules\nnorecursedirs = _build # Don't look inside of _build directories\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Changing <strong>pytest</strong> Behavior Dynamically</h2>\n<p>This is pretty nice, but if I need to ignore certain Python modules like\n<code>setup.py</code>? I can do this by creating a <code>conftest.py</code> module and\ndefining a <code>collect_ignore</code> variable.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># conftest.py\ncollect_ignore = [\"setup.py\", \"conftest.py\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>conftest.py</code> module can actually be defined per directory. So if\ntest behavior needs to change in different packages, just create\nadditional <code>conftest.py</code> modules. It's simple to do, but really\npowerful.</p>\n<p>The <code>conftest</code> module is capable of a lot of other things. Right now\nthere doesn't seem to be a page that documents it in full, so I'm\nconsidering submitting a documentation pull request. In the meantime, I\nlive off the <code>conftest.py</code> <a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/search.html?q=conftest&#x26;check_keywords=yes&#x26;area=default\">search\nresults</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>pytest</strong> is Plug-In Driven</h2>\n<p>One feature I really like about <strong>pytest</strong> is that much of it's default\ncapabilities are driven by about 20 plug-ins. It's a sign of maturity\nthat not only does it have plug-ins, but that most of the time this\nfeature is transparent. You can add new plug-ins to your project in a\n<a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/plugins.html#plugin-discovery-order-at-tool-startup\">number of\nways</a>,\nincluding <code>pip</code> installation from <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/\">PyPI</a>.\nFor locally defined plug-ins I prefer to rely on explicit <code>conftest.py</code>\ndeclarations:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># conftest.py\ncollect_ignore = [\"setup.py\", \"conftest.py\"]\npytest_plugins = [\"dream_plugin\", \"dream.utils.testplugin\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are a lot of <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&#x26;term=pytest-&#x26;submit=search\">third-party pytest\nplug-ins</a>,\nwhich brings me to the next major section: Integration with other tools\nand frameworks.</p>\n<h1>Django Integration is Just a Plug-In Away</h1>\n<p>If you want to use <strong>pytest</strong> instead of <strong>Django</strong>'s test runner and\nalso get the power of function-based tests, fixture functions, improved\ntest discover, and all the stuff I haven't covered, then check out\nand/or <code>pip</code> install\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-django\">pytest-django</a>. My\n<em>admittedly brief</em> usage on some of my existing projects has\ndemonstrating that my existing <strong>unittest</strong>-style tests work.</p>\n<p>That previous tests still function means that as with a pure Python\nproject, I can rely on existing <strong>unittests</strong> and write all my new tests\nas functions. I guess I could say that my existing Django projects just\ngot much easier to maintain.</p>\n<p>A good example of using <strong>pytest</strong> with <strong>Django</strong> can be found in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/blob/master/tox.ini\">django-braces' tox.ini\nfile</a>.</p>\n<h2>Twisted (and more) Integration is Just a Plug-In Away</h2>\n<p>The same goes for <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/\">Twisted</a> thanks to\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-twisted\">pytest-twisted</a>. There is\nalso a <a href=\"https://www.pylonsproject.org/\">Pyramid</a> plug-in that was just\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest_pyramid\">released</a>. I'm not sure\nif <a href=\"https://flask.pocoo.org/\">Flask</a> needs it, but I guess there will be\n<strong>Flask</strong> plug-in soon.</p>\n<h1>Integration With <code>setup.py</code></h1>\n<p>Fortunately, the documentation for <strong>pytest</strong> covers both adding a new\n<a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integrating-with-distutils-python-setup-py-test\">setup.py command-classes for\npytest</a>\nand <a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integration-with-setuptools-test-commands\">actual\nintegration</a>.\nThat's handy, but what I've found even more useful is the <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman/blob/develop/setup.py\">setup.py\nthat Jeff Knupp wrote for his Sandman\nproject</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you aren't experienced with writing Python packages and\nreadying them for <strong>PyPI</strong>, I recommend you read <a href=\"https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/\">Jeff Knupp's blog\npost on open sourcing\nprojects</a>.\nAmongst other things, it has an in-depth discussion about integration of\n<strong>pytest</strong> with <code>setup.py</code>. Anything I would write on the subject of\n<code>setup.py</code> integration would be just a cheap knock-off of Jeff's\nexcellent work.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>Tests are an important part of any project. While they increase the\nstability of a project, that unfortunately can come at the cost of the\nboredom of writing tests. Fortunately, <strong>pytest</strong> goes a long way to\nalleviating that boredom while also empowering Python code authors with\nlots of additional useful tools. I'm delighted to have finally\ndiscovered <strong>pytest</strong>. In the short time I've used <strong>pytest</strong>, it's\nsaved me days, if not weeks, of tedious work.</p>\n",

Today I'm going to cover a few more\nfeatures that I really enjoy: <code>raises</code> and <code>fixtures</code>.</p>\n<h1>The Intuitively Named <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong></h1>\n<p>When using <strong>pytest</strong>, you can assert whether or not an exception\noccurred via the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># test_exceptions.py\nfrom pytest import raises\n\ndef test_an_exception():\n    with raises(IndexError):\n        # Indexing the 30th item in a 3 item list\n        [5, 10, 15][30]\n\nclass CustomException(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef test_my_exception():\n    with raises(CustomException):\n        raise CustomException\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is similar to, but just a bit easier to remember than the\nimplementation in\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html\">unittest</a>.</p>\n<p>What I like about it is that even if I step away from code and tests for\nenough time to go on vacation and <a href=\"/i-married-audrey-roy.html\">get\nmarried</a>, when I come\nback I always remember the precise name of the <strong>context manager</strong> used\nto raise exceptions.</p>\n<h1>Fixtures as Function Arguments</h1>\n<p>When writing tests, it's not uncommon to need common objects used\nbetween tests. However, if you have a complicated process to generate\nthese common objects, then you have to write tests for your tests. When\nusing Python's venerable <strong>unittest</strong> framework, this always causes a\nspaghetti-code headache. However, via the virtue of simplicity,\n<strong>pytest</strong> helps keep our test code cleaner and more maintainable.</p>\n<p>Rather than try and explain that further, I'll write some code to get\nmy point across:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># test_fixtures.py\nfrom pytest import fixture\n\n@fixture  # Registering this function as a fixture.\ndef complex_data():\n    # Creating test data entirely in this function to isolate it\n    #   from the rest of this module.\n    class DataTypes(object):\n        string = str\n        list = list\n    return DataTypes()\n\ndef test_types(complex_data): # fixture is passed as an argument\n    assert isinstance(\"Elephant\", complex_data.string)\n    assert isinstance([5, 10, 15], complex_data.list)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Nice and simple, which is how I think test harnesses should operate.</p>\n<h2>Writing Tests for Fixtures</h2>\n<p>Let's pretend that the <code>complex_data()</code> is a terribly sophisticated\nfunction in it's own right. It's so sophisticated that I can't\ndetermine what it's actually doing, and I start to get worried.\nFortunately, because the <code>complex_data()</code> argument itself is written as\na function, I can easily write a test for it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># test_fixtures.py\n# note: this version of test_fixtures.py is built off the previous example\n\ndef test_complex_data(complex_data):\n    assert isinstance(complex_data, object)\n    assert complex_data.string == str\n    assert complex_data.list == list\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that I can easily write tests for my fixtures, that means I can\nrefactor them! I can replace difficult-to-use libraries with easier\nones, break up giant functions into little ones, and generally simplify\nthe unnecessarily complex.</p>\n<p>If you've ever been in that weird place where a <strong>unittest</strong> <code>setUp()</code>\nmethod is indecipherable, you know just how useful this can be.</p>\n<h2>Scoping Fixtures</h2>\n<p>What if I want a fixture that shares it's scope across several test\nfunctions?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># test_fixtures_with_scope.py\nfrom pytest import fixture\n\n@fixture(scope=\"module\")  # Registering fixture with module-level scope\ndef scope_data():\n    return {\"count\": 0}\n\ndef test_first(scope_data):\n    assert scope_data[\"count\"] == 0\n    scope_data[\"count\"] += 1\n\ndef test_second(scope_data):\n    assert scope_data[\"count\"] == 1\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Executing Teardown Code</h2>\n<p>I can tear down data structures in them. This is useful for any sort of\ndata binding, including file management.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># test_fixtures_with_teardown.py\nfrom pytest import fixture\n\n@fixture\ndef file_data(request): # The fixture MUST have a 'request' argument\n    text = open(\"data.txt\", \"w\")\n\n    @request.addfinalizer\n    def teardown():\n        text.close()\n    return text\n\ndef test_data_type(file_data):\n    assert isinstance(file_data, file)\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's really nice about this teardown feature is that when combined\nwith the fixture decorator's <code>scope</code> argument, I can exactly control\nwhen fixtures are taken down. This is an amazing piece of control. While\nI can and have duplicated this behavior using <strong>unittest</strong>, with\n<strong>pytest</strong> I can do it with more obvious code.</p>\n<h2>More <strong>pytext</strong> Fixture Features</h2>\n<p>Want to know more things you can do with <strong>pytest</strong> fixtures?

            "content_html": "<p>When I first encountered Holger Krekel's <a href=\"https://pytest.org/\">pytest</a>\nthis summer on <a href=\"https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/\">Jeff Knupp's\nblog</a>\nI felt like I had been living under a rock for years. I've been using\nPython's <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html\">unittest</a>\nframework since 2006 and <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose\">nose</a> to\nfind tests since 2008, but here was another test framework that actually\npredates <strong>nose</strong>! <strong>pytest</strong> is a very mature testing tool for testing\nPython. My favorite features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can run <strong>unittest</strong>, <strong>doctest</strong>, and <strong>nose</strong>, style tests\nsuites, making it ideal for new and legacy projects.</li>\n<li>It includes an intuitively named <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong> for\ntesting exceptions.</li>\n<li>You can define fixture arguments to generate baseline data. This is\nvery, very different from Django-style fixtures.</li>\n<li>Via <code>pytest.ini</code> you can change the behavior of pytest.</li>\n<li>Integrates nicely with <code>setup.py</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alright, lets dive into usage.</p>\n<h1>Test Discovery</h1>\n<p>The first thing that <strong>pytest</strong> provides is test discovery. Like\n<strong>nose</strong>, starting from the directory where it is run, it will find any\nPython module prefixed with <code>test_</code> and will attempt to run any defined\n<strong>unittest</strong> or function prefixed with <code>test_</code>. <strong>pytest</strong> explores\nproperly defined Python packages, searching recursively through\ndirectories that include <code>__init__.py</code> modules. Since an image is\nprobably easier to read, here's a sample directory structure annotated\nwith which files are checked for tests:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">address/\n    __init__.py\n    envelope.py \n    geo.py \n    test_envelope.py # checked for tests\n    test_geo.py # checked for tests\nrecords/\n    # pytest WON'T look here because it lacks __init__.py\n    records.csv\n    records.py\n    test_records.py # skipped because records/ lacks __init__.py\n__init__.py\nmain.py\ntest_main.py  # checked for tests\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that I've explained which files are checked for tests, here is how\n<strong>pytest</strong> determines what in each Python module is run as a test.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>pytest</strong> <em>just runs</em> <strong>doctests</strong> and <strong>unittests</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>pytest</strong> runs any function prefixed with <code>test_</code> as a test.</li>\n<li><strong>pytest</strong> does <a href=\"https://pytest.org/latest/nose.html#unsupported-idioms-known-issues\">its\nbest</a>\nto run tests written for <strong>nose</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, <strong>pytest</strong> behaves similarly to <strong>nose</strong> in test discovery. Next is\nanother feature that it shares with <strong>nose</strong> that I really enjoy.</p>\n<h1>Writing Tests as Functions</h1>\n<p>Python's <strong>unittest</strong> framework works, but it's always felt like too\nmuch boilerplate. I admit I like to write tests, but working with the\n<strong>unittest</strong> framework always dimmed that fun. I suppose this is why the\nassert keyword is useful, because it changes this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import unittest\n\nclass TestMyStuff(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_the_obvious(self):\n        self.assertEqual(True, True)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<p>to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> assert True == True\n</code></pre>\n<p>The former is nine lines of code (seven if you are using <strong>pytest</strong> to\nfind this test) to do what the assert statement does in one. However,\nthe nine lines of <strong>unittest</strong> code has a couple major advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not automatically run when stumbled on by the Python interpreter.</li>\n<li>Produces a more illuminating response than an uninformative\nAssertionError.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fortunately, tools like <strong>pytest</strong> (and <strong>nose</strong>) provide the ability to\nwrite tests as functions. This means we can combine the advantages of\nboth <code>unittest</code> and <code>assert</code> thus:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def test_the_obvious():\n    assert True == True\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we are down to just two lines of code! That could be increased to\nfive if we called <strong>pytest</strong> the same as we did in the <strong>unittest</strong>\nexample:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import pytest\n\ndef test_the_obvious():\n    assert True == True\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pytest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The next part is wonderful. If an <code>assert</code> statement fails, then\n<strong>pytest</strong> provides a very informative response. Let's check it out by\nrunning the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import pytest\n\ndef test_gonna_fail():\n    assert True == False  # Going to fail here on line 4\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pytest.main()\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I run this code, I get the following response:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">==================== FAILURES =====================\n----------------- test_gonna_fail -----------------\n\n    def test_gonna_fail():\n>       assert True == False\nE       assert True == False\n\nsamples.py:4: AssertionError\n======== 1 failed, 0 passed in 0.1 seconds ========\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, pytest identified where the <code>assert</code> statement failed on\nline 4 and displays exactly caused the failure (<code>True</code> did not equal\n<code>False</code>). Very nice indeed.</p>\n<h1>What's Next?</h1>\n<p>In my next <a href=\"/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-2.html\">blog\npost</a> I\ndescribe the following features of writing tests with <strong>pytest</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>raises</code> <strong>context manager</strong></li>\n<li>Fixtures</li>\n<li>Fixture Teardown</li>\n</ul>\n",

Considering Jeff's amazing\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5KG0F8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00B5KG0F8&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mlinar-20\">Writing</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5VXMRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00B5VXMRG&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mlinar-20\">Idiomatic</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/\">Python</a>, it\nmeant I was on the right track.</p>\n<p>The downside, of course, is implementation. Creating reusable Python\npackages has always been annoying. There are no defined/maintained best\npractices (especially for <code>setup.py</code>), so you end up cutting and pasting\nhacky, poorly understood, often legacy code from one project to the\nother. Some of it does nothing and some of it fails catastrophically on\nPython 3. There's a term for this sort of behavior, and it's called\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming\">Cargo Cult\nprogramming</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, while I was\n<a href=\"/made-up-statistics.html#debate-statistics\">ranting</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/\">Jeff</a>\n(and <a href=\"https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/\">Hynek\nSchlawack</a>)\nwas writing, someone was making\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">cookiecutter</a>.</p>\n<h2>cookiecutter does one thing and it does it well</h2>\n<p>What <a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">cookiecutter</a> does is\nmake creating and maintaining project templates easy and intuitive.

So if you don't\nlike how the author of cookiecutter's creates her projects, you can use\nsomeone else's or roll your own.</p>\n<p>Okay, enough talk, let's use cookiecutter to build a Python project.\nAssuming you have <a href=\"https://www.virtualenv.org/\">virtualenv</a> installed:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ pip install cookiecutter\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>note</strong>: In the works is a <a href=\"https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\">Homebrew</a>\npackage, and possibly packages for the various Linux distributions as\nwell.</p>\n<p>Done? Okay, now use cookiecutter to create your Python project. For this\nexample, I'm going to create a sample project called \"<em>cheese</em>\".:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git\nCloning into 'cookiecutter-pypackage'...\nremote: Counting objects: 183, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (100/100), done.\nremote: Total 183 (delta 87), reused 161 (delta 70)\nReceiving objects: 100% (183/183), 29.36 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (87/87), done.\nChecking connectivity... done\nfull_name (default is \"Audrey Roy\")? Daniel Greenfeld\nproject_name (default is \"your project\")? cheese\n... snip for brevity\n</code></pre>\n<p>See how it asks my full name? Well, at this point,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">cookiecutter</a> begins to ask a\nnumber of questions. These questions are actually specified in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json\">cookiecutter.json</a>\nfile for\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you've answered everything that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>\nwants, it generates your project.

Better yet, if Jeff (or someone)\nwants to implement Jeff's pattern, they can.</p>\n<p>In fact...</p>\n<h2>Creating cookiecutter templates is easy and intuitive</h2>\n<p>All you have to do is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\">cookiecutter-pypackage</a>\n<strong>and rename it</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Make the changes you desire.</strong> You can change anything you want,\nthe setup.py, the test handling, or perhaps add or remove from the\nquestions specified in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json\">cookiecutter.json</a>.\nRight now <strong>repo_name</strong> is a mandatory\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json\">cookiecutter.json</a>\nfield, but there is an issue submitted to have that changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Remember that renders everything in</strong>\n<a href=\"https://jinja.pocoo.org/\">Jinja2</a>.

So if you add a field to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/blob/master/cookiecutter.json\">cookiecutter.json</a>,\nall you have to do to see it in a templates is write:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-django\"># Place in Python, HTML.

In fact, there is already a growing ecosystem of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter#available-templates\">cookiecutter\ntemplates</a>,\nincluding Python, <a href=\"https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask\">Flask</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/cookiecutter/\">Django</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-jquery\">JQuery</a> templates.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is already a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage\">fork</a> of\ncookiecutter-pypackage that even more closely matches Jeff Knupp's\ndesign.</p>\n<h2>Additional cookiecutter features</h2>\n<p>Here are more things to like about cookiecutter:</p>\n<h3>cookiecutter is focused</h3>\n<p>It doesn't handle deployment, serving of HTTP, testing, or anything\nelse. All it does is project templates. It follows those classic words,\n\"<em>It's programmed to do one thing and do it well</em>\".</p>\n<h3>Supports all modern versions of Python</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2.6</li>\n<li>Python 2.7</li>\n<li>Python 3.3</li>\n<li>Even PyPy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>cookiecutter is modular</h3>\n<p>It's not built off a single giant function, or a complex architecture.\nInstead, it's comprised of a number of relatively simple functions.\nWhy? Well this way you can import easily elements of cookiecutter into\nother projects, and it plays into the next feature:</p>\n<h3>cookiecutter is tested</h3>\n<p>The project has as of August 20th 2013, <a href=\"https://coveralls.io/r/audreyr/cookiecutter?branch=master\">98% test\ncoverage</a>,\nwith an intention to increase it to 100%. This makes handling the\nfollowing things much easier/safer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implementing new features without breaking existing ones.</li>\n<li>Handling new versions of Python as they emerge.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>cookiecutter isn't just for Python packages</h3>\n<p>That's correct. While at the moment there is only\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-jquery\">cookiecutter-jquery</a>,\nthere is nothing to stop developers from using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">cookiecutter</a> to create\ntemplates for anything. The way it renders output is designed to\naccommodate customizations for any tool.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to my next point...</p>\n<h3>cookiecutter isn't just for Python developers</h3>\n<p>Even if you don't know Python you can use\n<a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\">cookiecutter</a>. The templating\nis done via <a href=\"https://jinja.pocoo.org/\">Jinja2</a>, which isn't far off from\nother template languages like Mustache, Handlebars, or Liquid. if you\nare worried about collisions between templating systems, just use\nJinja2's <code>{% raw %}</code> template tag:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-django\">{# Jinja2's raw template to escape the Liquid template inside #}\n{% raw %} {# Liquid template from here on #}\n&#x3C;ul id=\"products\">\n{% for product in products %}\n&#x3C;li>\n  &#x3C;h2>{{ product.title }}&#x3C;/h2>\n  Only {{ product.price | format_as_money }}\n\n  &#x3C;p>{{ product.description | prettyprint | truncate: 200  }}&#x3C;/p>\n\n&#x3C;/li>\n{% endfor %}\n&#x3C;/ul>\n{% endraw %}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\"><img src=\"/images/cookiecutter_medium.png\" alt=\"Cookiecutter logo\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update 09/20/2013</strong>: Test coverage increased to 98% from 91%.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Many of them don't say\nthis out loud.</li>\n<li>7% of Python developers rolled their own solution and <strong>wish they\ncould switch over.</strong></li>\n<li>3% of Python developers rolled their own solution and are fiendishly\ndelighted with how they have guaranteed their own job security\nforever.

So let me add another controversial topic, this time the never\nending template debate in Python:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>70% of python developers prefer\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/templates/\">non-XML</a>\n<a href=\"https://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/\">templates</a>.</li>\n<li>25% of python developers prefer <a href=\"https://www.makotemplates.org/\">XML</a>\ntemplates.</li>\n<li>5% of python developers wonder why we don't just use the\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatstrings\">str.format()</a>\nmethod and be done with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The display for this data is a lovely pie chart as seen below. In order\nto make it appear more useful, I made it a 3-D pie chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/templates.png\" alt=\"image\">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>\n<h1>Pydanny Made Up Python Web Optimization Statistics</h1>\n<p>I sometimes get asked how to best optimize a Django site. My answer is\n'optimize your queries and use caching'. On the other hand, there are\nthose who disagree with me and start switching out Django internals\nbefore doing anything silly like looking at I/O. My bet is this same\nthing happens with other frameworks such as Flask and Pyramid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20% developers argue switching template languages.</li>\n<li>80% developers argue using caching and load balancing.</li>\n<li>100% Django/Pyramid/Flask/etc core developers argue using caching\nand load balancing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/optimization.png\" alt=\"image\">{.img-polaroidalign-center}</p>\n<p>Of all the made up statistics in this blog post, I suspect this is the\none closest to the truth of things.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"debate-statistics\"></span>\n<a href=\"#debate-statistics\">Pydanny Made Up Debate Statistics</a></h1>\n<p>Alright, let's conclude this article with some statistics I cooked up\nin regards to various Python related topics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>95% of developers trying to create reusable Python packages have\n<strong>no freaking idea</strong> as to whether or not we should be using\nsetuptools, distribute, or distribute2 and wish there was a <strong>clear\nexplanation on the front page</strong> of PyPI as to what we should be\nusing and how. Something like a link to the <a href=\"https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\">Python Packaging User\nGuide</a>\nmight be nice!</li>\n<li>99% of us get frustrated with trying to reconcile the pronunciations\nof PyPI with PyPy.</li>\n<li>97.2% of our family and friends have no idea what Two Scoops of\nDjango is about.</li>\n<li>62% of Python developers are wondering if Tulip will make their\nprojects more web scale.</li>\n<li>49% of Twisted developers wish that Python had accepted their\nstandard instead of PEP-8.</li>\n<li>42% of Python developers think Flask/Pyramid have awesome names that\ndon't get mispronounced the same way Django does.</li>\n<li>28% of Python developers wish they could find a way to get some\nSciPy into their projects.</li>\n<li>23.6% of us get web.py and web2py confused with each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No chart? Getting this one to look meaningful was turning into a\nherculean effort. I invite others to render this data into something\nthat look attractive and doesn't lose meaning. Come up with something\nimpressive and I'll put it into a follow-up blog post.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a reprint and update of an earlier\n<a href=\"https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/12/made-up-statistics.html\">article</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Added link to the <a href=\"https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\">Python Packaging User\nGuide</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>This is the first in a set of blog posts based on my experiences\ntraveling in various places around the world. This particular\nsafety-related post is about theft, not scams, which I may cover in\nanother article.</p>\n<p>For this first article, I'm hoping this gets on various technical RSS\nfeeds. I'm doing this because many of the readers of such feeds attend\nconferences and are strangers in far and distant places.</p>\n<h1>About Thieves</h1>\n<p>Thieves (or pick pockets) are everywhere. I've seen extremely\nsuspicious activity in Portland, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Barcelona,\nFlorence, Pisa, and Krakow. Years ago in Washington DC I had stuff\nstolen from me twice so I've been observant and careful ever since.\nAnywhere there are non-residents distracted by looking at new vistas\nwhile suffering from travel fatigue is where most thieves can be found.\nI've learned a lot by observation and doing research but I don't claim\nto be an expert. All I claim to be is someone who doesn't want to be\nripped off far from home.</p>\n<h1>The Basics: Any place with tourists is risky</h1>\n<p>While it can be said that thieves can be anywhere, the truth is that\nthey focus on where the tourists go. We carry money and expensive\nthings, are tired, distracted, and don't know our way around. For a\nthief, A moment of risk can yield hundreds or thousands of dollars of\nprofit from a traveler.</p>\n<h2>\"I've never had any problems there\"</h2>\n<p>I've heard this several times from local residents or travelers, often\nabout places with statistically high crime rates. You'll hear it too.</p>\n<p>All that means is that they've either been lucky or unobservant. It's\nbetter to avoid a miserable trip by being a least a little careful with\nyour identity, money, and electronics.</p>\n<h2>Listen to warnings before you go places</h2>\n<p>In Barcelona our host warned us about La Rambla, a tourist-heavy street\nthat's notoriously thick with thieves. While we're always careful, we\nwere especially observant there, and enjoyed the very lovely and\nfriendly downtown Barcelona without incident.</p>\n<p>Conversely, don't pay attention to warnings at locations. Public\nnotices about thieves are a nasty trap. When you see them you check your\nmost expensive things, giving away the location of money, jewelry,\nwatches, and cell phones.</p>\n<h2>Watch how local residents protect themselves</h2>\n<p>In suspicious places you'll notice local men with their hands in their\npockets. Why? It's because they are literally keeping their hands on\nthe money.</p>\n<p>In the same places, local women will take a shirt, sweater, or even a\nnewspaper and have it on top of their purse with their arm on top of\nthat. Where \"man-purses\" are acceptable wear, men will do the same.</p>\n<h2>Good thieves Look like tourists or non-criminals</h2>\n<p>Some people or articles warn you about this or that ethnicity or how\npeople dress. That's not just racist and shallow, it's stupid and\ninaccurate.</p>\n<p>Thieves simply don't want to be noticed, and if noticed they want\nescape to be as easy as possible. Which means the more active and\nsuccessful ones dress and act like everyone around you. Which means, for\nexample, in Europe the better thieves are of Caucasian descent and dress\nlike American visitors.</p>\n<p>Do note that criminals from a non-majority ethnicity do exist, but they\naren't likely to be thieves. This is because being an ethnic minority\nmakes them easier to spot and track down. Also, the all-too-human\njustice system is harsher on them. Instead, they are often the ones\npreying on tourists by selling cheap, overpriced trinkets on the\nsidewalks to tourists who often don't realize they are breaking local\nlaws by purchasing from them.</p>\n<h2>Underage thieves are fearless</h2>\n<p>Underage thieves have the benefit of that they don't have to worry\nabout the justice system. In many places the police can't arrest\nchildren under a certain age and have to let them go. Also, if they are\ncaught, if they are in a gang, an older family member\" will come up,\nrebuke them publicly, and most people will let it go.</p>\n<h1>An ounce of preperation...</h1>\n<p>It's a good idea to spend a little time and money getting a few things\nbefore you travel. Why? Cause here are the easiest targets in rough\norder of ease for thieves (1 is super-easy, 7 is merely easy):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Backbacks without locks worn on the back. <strong>Warning</strong>: Don't put\npassports in your backback!</li>\n<li>Fanny pack or wallet in the back pocket.</li>\n<li>Grocery or store-purchase bag</li>\n<li>Any outside-pocket cellphone holder.</li>\n<li>Suitcases.</li>\n<li>Wallet in the front pocket.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Don't be stupid</h2>\n<p>At least one travel writer advocates putting your stuff in a local\ngrocery or store bag. That way you \"fit in\", thieves ignore you, and\nyou can confidently enjoy your visit.</p>\n<p>This is <em>mind-bogglingly stupid</em>.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Confidence means you allow yourself to be distracted.</li>\n<li>Unless you live somewhere, you stand out.</li>\n<li>Grocery or store bags are not designed to carry things for hours on\nend. They break.</li>\n<li>Grocery or store bags are one of the easiest target for thieves.\nThey either don't close adequately or are the perfect target for\nrazor armed thieves.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Your wallet</h2>\n<p>Take your ID out and only keep a very small amount of money in your\nwallet, which should be in your front pocket. Take the credit cards out\nand put them in secret stashes. If you really want a credit card in your\nwallet, get one linked to a bank account with just enough money for the\nday in it. Add more money to it as you need.</p>\n<h2>Shorten the Straps</h2>\n<p>Keep the straps of your stuff short and in your hands. When walking next\nto a street, keep bags on the far side from the road. Moped thieves will\nwill snatch and pull you until the straps break.</p>\n<h2>Use secret stashes on your person</h2>\n<p>Most sporting good stores sell money belts and underclothes pouches. Use\nthe money belt to store cash. Use an underclothes pouch to store your\npassport and at least one credit card. For underclothes pouches I\nrecommend you open packages and feel the material against your skin.</p>\n<h2>Consider buying anti-theft backpacks / laptop bags</h2>\n<p>We prefer <strong>PacSafe</strong> brand gear because the clasps are hidden and\nrequire a trick to open. Their stuff also has steel wire woven into\ntheir straps and fabric, meaning they can't get cut by a razor. PacSafe\nstuff isn't cheap but the peace of mind has been definitely worth the\nprice. We've relied on the PacSafe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Metrosafe-Anti-Theft-Tablet-Laptop/dp/B00AVXDELI/?tag=ihpydanny-20\">laptop\nbag</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Luggage-Slingsafe-Shoulder-Black/dp/B006QLMDH0/?tag=ihpydanny-20\">shoulder\nbag</a>\nfor about 18 months now and they've been awesome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Metrosafe-Anti-Theft-Tablet-Laptop/dp/B00AVXDELI/?tag=ihpydanny-20\"><img src=\"https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lh%2B2goeNL._SL500_SS80_.jpg\" alt=\"My laptop bag\"></a></p>\n<p><em>My laptop bag</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Luggage-Slingsafe-Shoulder-Black/dp/B006QLMDH0/?tag=ihpydanny-20\"><img src=\"https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jF8RBoBEL._SL500_SS80_.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey&#x27;s shoulder bag\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Audrey's shoulder bag</em></p>\n<h1>Identifying Thief Tactics</h1>\n<p>Being a successful thief requires the same skills as a magician.\nObservation, distraction, misdirection, staged audience members, and\ntiming are how they do it.</p>\n<p>Here are some common techniques they use:</p>\n<h2>The Big Local Attraction</h2>\n<p>While you are gazing at the masterpiece of architecture, hungrily\npeering at the door menu, or the incredible street performance, your\nfocus is off your stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Train yourself so when you start to feel distracted to put\nyour arm or hand on your most expensive stuff.</p>\n<h2>The Magician</h2>\n<p>For reference, this is literally the same sort of sleight-of-hand that\nmagicians use.</p>\n<p>Pickpockets often have a newspaper, expensive jacket, or nice sweater in\none hand to block what they are doing. While they engage you in friendly\nconversation they use the prop to block your like of sight from their\nother hand, which is busy. Especially good thieves don't even bother\nwith the props and just rely on the width of their arm to block lines of\nobservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: If someone you don't know shows something up close to\nyou, back off. In fact, just apologize and keep your distance. It's\nperfectly okay to not follow \"local custom\".</p>\n<h2>The Spill</h2>\n<p>If anyone throws anything at you, or if something is spilled on you, the\nthief helps you clean up, their accomplice is going through your stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Back up and start screaming \"Help, Thief\" because it\nmeans you've been targeted and are under active scam. Cover your stuff\nwith your arms and hands.</p>\n<h2>The Fall</h2>\n<p>This one is hard to deal with, especially for me.</p>\n<p>If a person falls or stumbles around you, don't help them, regardless\nof their age or apparent infirmity. While you help them their accomplice\nis taking from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Unless there is obvious injury, back off and let the\nlocals take care of it, or find the police.</p>\n<h2>The Gift</h2>\n<p>This year the new trick is for someone to ask you if you want them to\ntake pictures of you using your camera or cell phone. You hand them your\ncamera and they start running. <em>You've literally 'gifted' them your\ncamera!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Look for someone to take your picture, never the other way\naround.</p>\n<h2>Your Room</h2>\n<p>While staying at a hotel/hostel/BnB you go out for the day in a place\nwithout a safe. When you come back your valuables are gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: No safe? Carry your valuables!</p>\n<h1>If you catch a thief</h1>\n<p>You've caught them in the act. Maybe you've grabbed them or maybe they\nstarted running. Follow these steps to avoid injury and even death.</p>\n<h2>DON'T CHASE THIEVES</h2>\n<p>Whatever you do, don't chase thieves. Thieves of all ages are usually\nin gangs or have friends nearby. Their 'backup' carry weapons ranging\nfrom sticks to knives to guns. People die from chasing thieves every\nyear in every country. Nothing you are carrying is worth your life.</p>\n<h2>Call for help</h2>\n<p>Learn how to yell \"<em>Help, Thief!</em>\" in the local language. Often the\nlocals may deal with it as they hate thieves since crime damages their\nbusinesses and local reputation. In fact sometimes the response is\noverwhelmingly violent. There are stories of would-be victims in Africa,\nIndia, and Europe intervening to save the life of a would-be thief's\nlife.</p>\n<h2>The Police</h2>\n<p>It's pretty universal police who deal with street crime wear uniforms.\nWork with them and if they ask you if you want to press charges, do so.\nOtherwise in many places they have to let the person go.</p>\n<h2>DANGER: The 'undercover' police</h2>\n<p>Anyone not wearing a uniform and claiming to be 'undercover' is an\naccomplice, scam artist, or worse. If they 'come to help':</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don't give up any identification.</li>\n<li>Demand that uniformed police be summoned by radio or phone to this\nlocation immediately. If the 'undercover' police refuse, then they\nare a scam or worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't leave the spot!</strong> If 'undercover' police try to get you\nto come with them, refuse loudly. If they try to force you away,\nstart yelling as if your life is in danger, <strong>because it is</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>In Closing</h1>\n<p>Theft is real. Go to Youtube and spent 10 minutes searching on \"thief\"\nor \"pickpocket\" for proof. Most of the videos are surveillance videos,\nbut when magicians talk about theft it's pretty fun to watch.</p>\n<p>In any case, it's easy to dramatically decrease your chances of being a\nvictim of this kind of crime by being prepared and vigilant.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>The following are my notes, observations, and resources on the subject\nof working with Python 3 (with or without Django).</p>\n<p>Recently I've become involved in a couple of Django efforts that used\nPython 3.3. The quick summary of what I learned is pretty much what I\nexpected: Out of the box Django 1.5 (and the pending 1.6 release) works\nfine with Python 3.3.2.</p>\n<h1>Use Python 3.3.2!</h1>\n<p>Myself and others have encountered problems with using Django 1.5+ and\nearlier versions of Python 3. The issues can be tricky; for example\n<code>syncdb</code> fails in curious ways on Python 3.3.0.</p>\n<p>The answer, for me, is to use Python 3.3.2 and don't look back.</p>\n<h1>Checking for Python 3 Compatibility</h1>\n<p>The steps I use are below. They are in rough order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look up the package on <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/\">PyPI</a> and see\nif any of it's trove classifiers mention Python 3 status.</li>\n<li>See if a pull request for Python 3 support is outstanding.</li>\n<li>Run the test suite using Python 3.3</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html\">2to3</a> to scan the\ncode for issues.</li>\n<li>If a Django project, check the models for <code>__str__()</code> methods. If it\nhas them, it's a pretty good indicator it's Python 3.3 friendly.</li>\n<li>Make a judgement call.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Packages that work with Python 3</h1>\n<p>In this section I'm listing a few of the Python and Django packages\nI'm using that worked without me having to do anything sort of\nmodification or pull request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Django 1.5 and 1.6 beta</li>\n<li>Pillow (drop-in replacement for PIL)</li>\n<li>South</li>\n<li>django-bootstrap-registration (templates for django-registration)</li>\n<li>django-braces</li>\n<li>django-crispy-forms</li>\n<li>requests</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Conversion process</h1>\n<p>How I convert Python 2 code to Python 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use 2to3 until you get used to not using it.</li>\n<li>Fix any problems you find in the code. Try to keep solutions as\nsimple as possible.</li>\n<li>Submit the pull request.</li>\n<li>Politely poke the package owner to accept the pull request.</li>\n<li>Once the owner accepts the pull request, gently poke the package\nowner to push the update to PyPI.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Packages that needed conversion</h1>\n<p>Here are four packages worth noting that had to be converted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unicode-slugify</li>\n<li>django-registration</li>\n<li>django-stripe-payments (in progress)</li>\n<li>django-nose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's get into some detail for each package:</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-slugify\">unicode-slugify</a></h2>\n<p>This is a handy, more unicode friendly replacement for Django's\ndjango.utils.text.slugify function. It failed on Django 1.6 beta, so I\nforked it, submitted a successful pull request after testing it on\nPython 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3.2. The Mozilla team pushed it to PyPI\nand even gave me\n<a href=\"https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/profile/pydanny\">badges</a> for\nmy efforts!</p>\n<p>In the future I would like to see this little package work without the\ndependency of Django itself, and I've had a couple replacement\ndependencies suggested.</p>\n<h2>django-registration</h2>\n<p>With the 1.0 release, it's been updated for Django 1.5, <em>unless</em> you\nuse customized User models or Python 3. I really needed this on PyPI,\nbut the maintainer is very busy. Therefore, I forked the project,\nrenamed it to <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-reg\">django-reg</a>\nwhile referencing the original, and pushed it to PyPI. Not ideal, but\nsometimes you have to do what you have to do.</p>\n<p>Lesson learned: In the future skip these issues and just use\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-allauth\">django-allauth</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 08/08/2013</strong>: All my Python 3 work is now on django-allauth.\nThis way I don't have to do the work of maintaining a compatibility\nbranch.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-stripe-payments\">django-stripe-payments</a> (in progress)</h2>\n<p>While django-zebra is better known for handling stripe payments, I\nprefer to use Eldarion's excellent, well-maintained and tested\ndjango-stripe-payments. It was delayed because django-nose wasn't\nPython 3 compatible, but that's been fixed as of at least 7/28/2013.\nUnfortunately, it's Travis-CI tests fail with the Django 1.5 era custom\nuser model because of what might be a linter misconfiguration. In\ntheory, the just released version of pylint (1.0) should work without\nany problems.</p>\n<p>Of course, I informed the maintainers of my efforts and problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 07/30/2013</strong>: Updated the text to reflect the current status of\nthe linter problems I'm having.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 08/08/2013</strong>: While django-stripe-payments is useful, it\ndoesn't do everything that I need. I tried extending it's logic into a\nthird app, but that was proving unweildy. Therefore, I forked the\nproject to <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dj-stripe\">dj-stripe</a>, which\nhas the features and compatibility that I need.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nose\">django-nose</a></h2>\n<p>Today, I asked the maintainer to visit an outstanding pull request that\nadds Python 3 compatibility. It's a good idea to do this since they\nmight already be working on it, or may have observations they want to\nshare.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 7/28/2013</strong>: Jeff Balogh pushed a Python 3.3.2+ compatible\nversion up to PyPI a few days ago. Makes everything so much better!</p>\n<h1>Dealing with Slow Maintainers</h1>\n<p>For what it's worth, from experience ranting to or about slow-moving\nmaintainers is absolutely counter-productive. People have lives and jobs\nthat sometimes get in the way of open source. It's more productive to\nbe patient, be polite, and if necessary do an absolutely minimal fork or\nfind a working alternative.</p>\n<h1>Handy Resources</h1>\n<p>The following are two useful resources on converting Python 2 to Python\n3. I don't follow their methods exactly, I just use them as rough\nguidelines for my own workflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cJMGvAYYUyY\">Porting Django apps to Python 3</a> video\nby Jacob Kaplan-Moss</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://python3porting.com/\">Porting to Python 3</a> book (free HTML or\npaid PDF, Kindle, ePub) by Lennart Regebro</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For various Python 3 recipes, I keep my kindle reader open to this\npriceless gem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B00DQV4GGY/?tag=ihpydanny\">Python Cookbook, 3rd\nEdition</a>\nbook by David Beazley and Brian K. JOnes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>\n<p>This blog post makes it seems like I've put in a lot of work getting\nthings to Python 3, but that isn't the case at all. In fact, for the\nmost part the transition has been trivial. There are a few minor\nhiccups, but nothing that's killing a whole day or destroying a\ndeadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit of using Python 3?</strong> I get to call myself a <strong>Python 3\nHipster</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Downside of using Python 3?</strong> A little bit of extra homework on each\nproject. However, each time I fix something it's done and I've made\nthe world a better place.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>In my opinion, the concepts behind Django's model forms can be listed\nin just six (6) bullets. The bullets I've marked in <strong>bold</strong> at the top\nare the topic of this blog post, while the two of these that were\n<a href=\"/core-concepts-django-forms.html\">covered in a previous blog post on Django\nforms</a> are at\nbottom of my list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ModelForms select validators based off of Model field\ndefinitions.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ModelForms don't have to display/change all available fields.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables.</strong></li>\n<li>Forms are \"just\" Python constructs. (covered previous)</li>\n<li>Forms validate Python dictionaries. (covered previous)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML.</h1>\n<p>If I create a Django model:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then attach it to a ModelForm:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    class Meta:\n\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can render it in a template, or for better clarity in this post, the\nPython REPL:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm\n>>> mf = MyModelForm()\n>>> mf\n&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>\n>>> print(mf)\n&#x3C;tr>&#x3C;th>&#x3C;label for=\"id_title\">Title:&#x3C;/label>&#x3C;/th>\n&#x3C;td>&#x3C;input id=\"id_title\" name=\"title\" maxlength=\"100\" type=\"text\" />&#x3C;/td>&#x3C;/tr>\n</code></pre>\n<h1>ModelForms select validators based off of Model field definitions.</h1>\n<p>One of the nice things about Django is that its forms library protects\nyour models. It does this by assigning one or more of Django's many\nbuilt-in validators to the form fields it generates, and using them to\ncheck incoming data. Let's dive in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm\n>>> mf = MyModelForm()\n>>> mf\n&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>\n>>> mf.fields\n{'title': &#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x102474bd0>}\n>>> field = mf.fields['title']\n>>> field.max_length\n100\n>>> field.validators\n[&#x3C;django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator object at 0x102403b10>]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each individual field contains a list of validators (in this case, just\none validator) supplied by Django and any ModelForm customizations that\nmight have been done.</p>\n<p>If you want to add more validators to a ModelForm (perhaps we want our\ntitle field to require at least 20 characters) one way to do it is by\noverriding the field definition in the ModelForm class's <code>__init__</code>\nmethod. That's a mouthful, so I'll just demonstrate in code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)     \n        self.fields[\"title\"].min_length = 20\n        self.fields[\"title\"].validators.append(MinLengthValidator)\n\n    class Meta:\n\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we stop/start the shell, we now see some new elements added to the\nform object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> # Don't forget to stop/start the Django shell!\n>>> from myapp.forms import MyModelForm\n>>> mf = MyModelForm()\n>>> mf\n&#x3C;__main__.MyForm object at 0x1023c8bd0>\n>>> mf.fields\n{'title': &#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x1023ee810>}\n>>> field = mf.fields['title']\n>>> field.max_length\n100\n>>> field.min_length\n20\n>>> field.validators\n[&#x3C;django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator object at 0x10240c7d0>, &#x3C;django.core.validators.MinLengthValidator object at 0x1023eef90>]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have two validators for the field!</p>\n<p>There are other ways to override the title field validators. The easiest\nbut not necessarily the best way is to replicate the ModelForm\ndefinition of the field in the form like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    title = forms.CharField(max_length=100, min_length=20)\n\n    class Meta:\n\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't like this technique. This makes it so we are defining the title\nfield in two places, once in the model and once in the form. I go into\nmore of the details and problems of this approach in my previous blog\npost at <a href=\"/overloading-form-fields.html\">Overloading Django Form\nFields</a>.</p>\n<h1>ModelForms don't have to display/change all available fields.</h1>\n<p>Before we dive into this section, let's increase our model to have two\nfields as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    slug = models.SlugField()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's say that we don't want to allow users the ability to change\nslugs on existing content, otherwise URLs will be broken. In this case,\nwe rely on the <code>fields</code> attribute of <code>ModelForm.Meta</code> to make it so we\nonly display what we want to display:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    class Meta:\n\n        model = MyModel\n        fields = ('title', )\n</code></pre>\n<p>Easy!</p>\n<h2>But what about ModelForm.Meta.excludes?</h2>\n<p>We advocate strongly against using <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>.</p>\n<p>In fact, when we were writing <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">Two Scoops of\nDjango</a> the majority of our technical\nreviewers as well as our security reviewer fervently insisted that we\nadvocate against use of <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>. We provide numerous\nwarnings about it's usage, and go in-depth as to why in <em>section\n21.12</em>. For reference, Django's own documentation is now including a\nrather mild warning (no warning box) on the subject at <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelforms-selecting-fields\">selecting the\nfields to\nuse</a>.\nI might try and get that addressed in the next few days...</p>\n<p>In any case, the problem with <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code> is similar to\nbut worse than duplicating field functionality. It means that changes to\nmodels (new fields for example) will display in associated forms\n<strong>unless</strong> you remember to modify the associated forms. Since a single\nmodel can have multiple forms, and we developers forget or leave\nprojects, you can understanding what sort of security nightmare this can\ncause.</p>\n<p>Do yourself a favor and stay away from <code>ModelForm.Meta.excludes</code>.</p>\n<h1>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables</h1>\n<p>In my <a href=\"/core-concepts-django-forms.html\">previous post of Django\nforms</a> I covered\n<em>forms validate dictionaries</em>. Well, ModelForms do the same thing AND\ngive us the power to save that validated dictionary to SQL tables. We\ndon't even need to involve web pages!</p>\n<p>This is really useful because it means that we can take data from any\nsource, be it user input from the web, JSON data fetched from an API,\nand even CSVs generated from Excel reports and transform that into data\nthat resides in SQL.</p>\n<p>Let's go over using our ModelForm with title/slug fields used with all\nthose methods. In our samples (web page, json, csv), we'll use\ngenerating a timestamp to demonstrate how we can modify the model data\nbefore it's saved, and we'll base all three examples off the model and\nModelForm combination listed below.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    timestamp = models.DateTimeField()\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import Forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\n\nclass MyModel(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    class Meta:\n\n        model = MyModel\n        fields = ('title', )\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now to our three examples!</p>\n<h2>Example #1 Web Page</h2>\n<p>This should look pretty familiar to many Django developers. it's the\ntraditional Django view pattern of processing simple model forms.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/views.py\nfrom django.core.shortcuts import render, redirect\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nfrom .forms import MyModelForm\n\n\ndef add_model(request):\n\n    if request.method == \"POST\":\n        form = MyModelForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n\n            # commit=False means the form doesn't save at this time.\n            # commit defaults to True which means it normally saves.\n            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)\n            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()\n            model_instance.save()\n            return redirect('victory')\n    else:\n        form = MyModelForm()\n\n    return render(request, \"my_template.html\", {'form': form})\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Example #2 API/JSON</h2>\n<p>In this example, we're validating the output of a RESTful API before\nletting it touch our database. It's critical that such APIs are not\nallowed to touch our systems without proper validation - don't make my\nmistakes! Also, even internally within a project it's really important\nto validate all data coming from different databases. And Django makes\nit easy!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/api/reitz.py\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nimport requests  # You are using requests-python, right?\n\nfrom .forms import MyModelForm\n\n\nclass ReitzApiException(Exception):\n    pass\n\n\ndef fetch_reitz_data(target_url):\n    response = requests.get(target_url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n\n        # generate the form from the response\n        form = MyModelForm(response.json())\n        if form.is_valid():\n            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)\n            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()\n            model_instance.save()\n            return model_instance\n\n        # Simplistic exception handling\n        raise ReitzApiException(form.errors)\n\n    # Simplistic exception handling\n    raise ReitzApiException(response.status_code)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Example #3 CSV Import</h2>\n<p>I'll admit my mistake again: I've written my own validation tools to\nhandle data coming from CSVs and Excel documents into Django projects.\nMy validation scripts always seem fragile, and they are. What I'm doing\ngoing forward is I'm leaning on form libraries to do the hard work of\nvalidating data and saving it to models.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import csv\n\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nfrom .forms import MyModelForm\n\n\ndef import_csv(filename):\n    rows = open(filename)\n    records_added = 0\n    errors = []\n    # Generate a dict per row, with the first CSV row being the keys.\n    for row in csv.DictReader(rows, delimiter=\",\"):\n\n        # Bind the row data to the MyModelForm\n        form = MyModelForm(row)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            model_instance = form.save(commit=False)\n            model_instance.timestamp = timezone.now()\n            model_instance.save()\n            records_added += 1\n        else:\n            errors.append(form.errors)\n\n    return records_added, errors\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>\n<p>I can think of three things:</p>\n<p><strong>Forget the HTML</strong>: For nearly every sort of occasion where new data is\ncoming into your system, form libraries save you from doing extra work\nand cover your behind. While my experience is with Django forms, there\nare many form libraries out there. The patterns explored in this post\nare certainly available in other web frameworks (see\n<a href=\"https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/category/forms/\">https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/category/forms/</a> for proof).</p>\n<p><strong>HTML Rendering Issues</strong>: No form library is going to do everything,\nand because of evolving standards, decent HTML rendering is a pain for\nform library authors. For example, Django's default form HTML rendering\nremains stuck in 2005 because if they had kept up with modern trends of\nHTML form layout we would have many different flavors of forms in Django\ncore (a testing nightmare). Which means, as a developer, it's important\nwhen using a new form library to learn how to override the default form\nHTML rendering.</p>\n<p><strong>What about AJAX?</strong>: Whoops! Does this mean I have to write another\nblog post? Not at all. In Django, AJAX is just another view, either\nfunction- or class-based. The secret is to validate the incoming data\nthe same way as you would any other view request by using forms.</p>\n",

However, that's not really the case.</p>\n<p>The short answer is we used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reStructuredText (RST)</li>\n<li>Google Documents</li>\n<li>Apple Pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/LateX\">LaTeX</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The long answer is the rest of this posting. Since writing the book was\nbroken up into three major stages '<em>alpha</em>', '<em>beta</em>', and\n'<em>final</em>', so have I broken up blog article.</p>\n<h1>Alpha Days</h1>\n<p>Some of the original alpha material was written in rough draft form as\nRST since it was what we were used to using. Unfortunately, the PDF\ngeneration wasn't to our liking, so we immediately began looking at\nother options. Since she enjoyed using it at MIT and because it gave us\ngreater individual control, <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey</a> wanted to\nswitch to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/LateX\">LaTeX</a>. I was worried\nabout the challenges of learning LaTeX, so we compromised and moved to\nGoogle Documents.</p>\n<p>For the most part, Google Documents was great in the early stages. The\nreal-time collaborative nature was handy, but the gem was the comment\nsystem. It gave us the ability to have line-by-line written dialogues\nwith our technical reviewers. However, Google Documents makes it\nnigh-impossible to use WYSIWYG editor styles, add in better print fonts,\nforced us to cut-and-paste code examples, and finally the PDF export\nsystem was flakey on our massive document.</p>\n<p>Our original thought was to convert the Google Document output to PDF\nand then modify it with Adobe InDesign. Upon trying it, we found it had\na lackluster user interface that had a steep learning curve and was\nprohibitively expensive ($550-$700). Our friend and reviewer, Kenneth\nLove of <a href=\"https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com\">Getting Started with\nDjango</a> fame, offered to do the\nconversion work, but we wanted to be able to update our work at will.\nAwesome as Kenneth might be, we couldn't expect him to drop what he was\ndoing to update the final output of our work whenever we wanted.</p>\n<p>Therefore, what we did in the week of January 10th-16th was convert the\nbook to Apple Pages, which is the word processor in Apple iWorks. This\nwas as painful as it sounds. We also discovered the day before launch\nthat Apple Pages doesn't create a sidebar PDF table of contents, which\na lot of people enjoy (including ourselves). Tired and exhausted from\nweeks of 16 hour days, we launched anyway on January 17th with the book\nweighing in at 5.1 MB.</p>\n<h1>Beta Experiences</h1>\n<p>People were so positive it really gave us a boost. Hundreds of people\nsent us feedback and we were delighted beyond words, with a significant\nportion sending us commentary/corrections about our writing and code.\nI'll admit I did get tired over a certain 'moat' mistake since I got\ncorrected on it over 50 times. However, the number of code corrections\nwe were getting was higher than expected. It was clear we needed to be\nable to import the code modules from testable chunks of real code. We\nhad so many kindle/epub requests we also needed the ability to render\nthe text attractively across multiple formats.</p>\n<p>After stumbling through RST, Google Documents, and Apple Pages different\ntools, I finally agreed with Audrey that the challenges of learning\nLaTeX was worth it. While we could have used RST, we would have had to\nuse LaTeX anyway for our customizations since when RST is converted to\nPDF it actually uses an interim step of LaTeX!</p>\n<p>So while I handled the corrections and feedback from thousands, Audrey\nbuilt the fundamentals of the LaTeX file structure. Audrey really got\nher hands dirty by teaching me LaTeX, since my brain is slow and thick.\nHere's a sample of what I've learned how to do, taken from Chapter 6,\nSection 1, Subsection 5 (6.1.5):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-latex\">\\subsection{Model Inheritance in Practice: The TimeStampedModel}\nIt's very common in Django projects to include a \\inlinecode{created} and \\inlinecode{modified} timestamp field on all your models. We could manually add those fields to each and every model, but that's a lot of work and adds the risk of human error. A better solution is to write a \\inlinecode{TimeStampedModel} \\index{TimeStampedModel} to do the work for us:\n\n\\goodcodefile{chapter_06/myapp/core/timestampedmodel.py}\n\nTake careful note of the very last two lines in the example, which turn our example into an abstract base class: \\index{abstract base classes}\n\n\\goodcodefile{chapter_06/myapp/core/class_meta.py}\n\nBy defining \\inlinecode{TimeStampedModel} as an abstract base class \\index{abstract base classes} when we define a new class that inherits from it, Django doesn't create a \\inlinecode{model\\_utils.time\\_stamped\\_model} table when syncdb is run.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once I got the hang of LaTeX, then began the hard work of converting the\nbook's current content from Apple Pages. That was a couple weeks of\ngrueling effort on my part while Audrey wrote more book material. Daily\nI would request a new LaTeX customizations, which Audrey would address.\nHowever, as she was working on literally rewriting the content of a\ndozen chapters including templates, testing, admin, and logging my\ninterruptions became an issue. So we enlisted the help of Italian\neconomist and LaTeX expert Laura Gelsomino. Thanks to her the desired\ntext formatting was achieved.</p>\n<p>During the conversion process we rewrote every single code example,\nputting them into easily testable projects, and pulled them into the\nbook via use of custom LaTeX commands called <code>\\goodcodefile{}</code> and\n<code>\\badcodefile{}</code>.</p>\n<p>Eventually I joined Audrey on rewriting and reviewing chapters and on\nFebruary 28th, the beta was launched. LaTeX generates lean PDFs so the\nbook came in at just 1.6 MB while adding a whopping 50 pages (25% more)\nof content.</p>\n<h1>Final Efforts</h1>\n<p>The final effort was focused on cleanup, new formats, presentation, and\nart.</p>\n<p>For cleanup, our amazing readers gave us so much feedback we could\nbarely keep up. We fought to keep our dialogues with them personal yet\nbrief. With reader oversight we corrected many of the 'quirks' of my\nwriting style (Audrey is a stickler for Strunk and White, I am not). We\nalso made numerous corrections based on feedback and our own\nobservations.</p>\n<p>With the guidance of fellow Python author <a href=\"https://hairysun.com/\">Matt\nHarrison</a> I wrote scripts that took the archaic\nHTML generated by LaTeX module tex4ht and rendered it into something\nthat Kindlegen could use to generate Kindle .mobi files. At first the\nresults looked awesome on modern kindles and other new ebook readers,\nbut was terrible on older devices. So I toned back the fancy stuff to\nwhat you see today. Getting technical books to look nice on all readers\nis really, really hard - and unfortunately some publishers take\nshortcuts that hurt the efforts of the authors. If you have problem with\nan e-book's format, please consider that before writing a negative\nreview about the final output.</p>\n<p>Speaking of mobile editions, we also wrote a second version of each\nPython example to deal with the smaller format. While libraries exist to\ndo the work for you, since I did a lot of it from scratch (albeit\ncoached by Matt) I had to dig into the lackluster .mobi/.epub\ndocumentation to figure out things like .ncx files.</p>\n<p><strong>note:</strong> If you want to be the self-published author of a technical\nbook I <em>strongly recommend</em> you read Matt's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ebook-Formatting-Mobi-EPUB-ebook/dp/B00BWQXHU6/ref=la_B0077BQLH6_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366041987&#x26;sr=1-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">Ebook Formatting: KF8,\nMobi &#x26;\nEPUB</a>.\nAlso check out his rst2epub2 library for converting RST files to various\nformats.</p>\n<p>While I worked on the mobile editions, Audrey focused on the print\nversion and adding more art and bits and pieces of new content. She\nfocused on clarity and flow, and the result is that the book feels even\nlighter to read and yet is dense with useful information. To test how\nthe book launched, she would order a copy from the printer and wait\nseveral days for it to arrive. Then she would inspect the cover and\ninterior with her incredibly exacting eye. It's a slow process, but\nAudrey wanted to make absolutely certain our readers would enjoy and use\nthe print edition.</p>\n<p>On April 10th we launched the final in PDF, Kindle, and ePub form. The\nPDF weighs in at 2.7 MB, and the Kindle file is a bit heaver. At some\npoint we'll do the work to reduce file size, but for now we're working\non other things.</p>\n<p>A week later we announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">print version of the\nbook</a>.\nPeople seem to really like the design and feel of the physical book, and\nwe've even had requests for t-shirts.</p>\n<h1>Thoughts</h1>\n<p>Writing a technical book was really hard. Crazy hard. Also very\nsatisfying. We could have made more money doing just client work, but\nthis was a dream come true. Sometimes money doesn't matter.</p>\n<h2>Whither Two Scoops of Django?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django\n1.5</a> will still receive periodic corrections,\nbut won't see new content unless it's security related for Django 1.5.\nDon't worry though, for when Django 1.6 comes nigh, we'll commence\nwork on Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django <strong>1.6</strong> (<strong>TSD\n1.6</strong>). The plan is to update practices as needed and hopefully add more\ncontent on testing, logging, continuous integration, and more. Like\nit's predecessor TSD 1.6 will be written using LaTeX.</p>\n<p>That said, if I ever fulfill my dream of writing fiction I'll just use\nMatt Harrison's <a href=\"https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2epub2\">rst2epub2</a>\nlibrary.</p>\n<h2>Concerns About Open Sourcing</h2>\n<p>We've considered open sourcing our current book generation system, but\ninstallation is rather challenging and requires serious\nAudrey/Laura-level LaTeX knowledge combined with my experience with\nPython. Unfortunately, from our experience on managing other open source\nprojects, dealing with requests for documentation and assistance would\ntake up a prohibitive amount of our time. Honestly, we would rather\nwrite another book or sling code.</p>\n<h2>Book Generation as a Service?</h2>\n<p>Another option is turning our system into a service, which would convert\nexisting RST or even MarkDown to LaTeX so it could generate books in the\nTwo Scoops format. Doing this would require at least a month of\nfull-time work on both of our parts, and we have no idea as to the\ninterest level. We think it would be a low amount of interest, but then\nagain, hasn't <a href=\"https://leanpub.com\">leanpub</a> done pretty well using this\nmodel of business?</p>\n<p>In any case we're working on other projects. Maybe even a new technical\nbook...</p>\n",

While\nlooking at possible rentals or even mortgages, we were idly (dreaming\nreally... still paying off debts incurred from last year) looking at\nhow much a room/apartment would cost to rent in Europe. To our surprise,\nwe found a lot of good options that cost less then it would to pay\nmonthly rent/mortgage in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p><strong>o_O</strong></p>\n<p>Then, we discovered an amazing travel deal. It combined a very cheap\nred-eye flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, and a slow\ntrans-atlantic ship from Port Miami to Barcelona, about as much as a\ncheap hotel but with free food! If we avoid alcohol and any extra fees,\nit's actually extremely inexpensive. Being mostly disconnected from the\ninternet would mean we could really focus on a couple of critical\nprojects. If only we had a business justification for going to\nEurope...</p>\n<p><strong>It just so happens that we have business in Europe.</strong></p>\n<p>Our plan is to spend a few months in Europe before returning back to the\nUSA. We'll work hard on the ship, work hard when we arrive, and just\nget stuff done. It's not a vacation, but it is Europe, and there is\nsuch a thing as weekends.</p>\n<p>We'll be spending a few days in early May in Barcelona, then making our\nway to Poland for several weeks. Yes, we're attending <a href=\"https://djangocircus.com\">Django\nCircus</a>, plus I want to investigate some family\nroots. After Poland, we're thinking either France, Italy, Hungary,\nEngland, Belgium, Scotland, Ireland, and other options. We'll see where\nthe winds and affordable AirBNB places take us.</p>\n<p>When do we go back? Well, we plan to stay for at least two months. Even\nif we go back to the USA, we would have at least been in Europe for May\nand June. How cool is that?</p>\n<p>We could have talked ourselves out of going. We nearly did. However,\neven with our workload this is the chance of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the next two weeks I'll only be able to access the\ninternet for a few minutes per day. Please expect my responses to emails\nand tweets to be slower than normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the middle of all of this, I was invited to keynote\nDjango Circus:\n<a href=\"https://blog.djangocircus.com/post/48439600279/meet-daniel-greenfeld\">https://blog.djangocircus.com/post/48439600279/meet-daniel-greenfeld</a></p>\n",

Today I got to see my dream come true, a\nprinted\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">book</a>\nis out there with my name on it.</p>\n<p>Also, I have a confession to make. When it comes to technical books, I\nreally prefer the print version. For me, nothing beats being able to\nflip through pages of a hardcopy next to a keyboard, or simply reading\nwhile I'm on a bus, train, or plane. So this adds to my excitement when\nI get to say that the book that <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/\">Audrey Roy</a> and\nI wrote together is in\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">print</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: As of April 17th it's only available in the US.

It\nwasn't easy, but the growing volume of positive feedback and\nsuggestions from readers kept us going.</p>\n<p>Between the Alpha and Beta releases we switched over to LaTeX. Audrey\ntaught it to me in February, and I'm proud to say I've progressed from\nabsolute neophyte to beginner. We chose it because of it's fine-grained\ncontrol over layout for the PDF and print versions. Creating the Kindle\nand ePub versions from LaTeX was harder thanks to using LaTeX, but\neverything's automated now so making updates is easy.

For now, let's just say that he gave and\ntaught us so much and asked us for nothing in return, which is why we\ncontinue to give free copies of the PDF edition of the\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1366166104&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">book</a>\nto developers in need, as well as try to stay in contact with all\nrecipients of the free PDF.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you are a developer in need, and can't afford a copy, drop\nus a note at <a href=\"mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com\">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a> explaining your situation.

He's right:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from myapp.forms import MyForm\n>>> # class\n>>> MyForm\n&#x3C;class 'myapp.forms.MyForm'>\n>>> # object\n>>> form = MyForm()\n>>> form\n&#x3C;myapp.forms.MyForm object at 0x1023f1450>\n>>> # iterable\n>>> [x for x in form]\n[&#x3C;django.forms.forms.BoundField object at 0x102495990>]\n>>> [x for x in form.fields]\n['title']\n>>> # dictionary-like\n>>> form.fields['title']\n&#x3C;django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x1024a17d0>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Understanding the structure of Django forms is really useful. This\nstructure is what allows the modification mechanism that I described in\nmy <a href=\"/overloading-form-fields.html\">previous post</a>.</p>\n<p>We don't have to stop in just the <code>forms.py</code> module. You can also\nmodify forms in views (either the classic <code>views.py</code> module or in\nwhatever API library you might be using):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django import forms\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.views.generic import FormView\n\nclass MyFormView(FormView):\n\n    form_class = MyForm\n\n    def get_form(self, form_class):\n        form = form_class(**self.get_form_kwargs())\n        form.fields['favorite_icecream'] = forms.ChoiceField(\n            label=\"What is your favorite flavor from this list?\",\n            choices=((0, \"Chocolate\"), (1, \"Vanilla\"), (2, \"Berry\")),\n            widget=forms.RadioSelect,\n            required=True\n        )\n        return form\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        # Get user's favorite ice cream.\n        # You can do anything you want with it\n        favorite_icecream = form.cleaned_data['favorite_icecream']\n\n        # return the anticipated redirect\n        return redirect(\"home\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, with an understanding of basic Python types and some\nexperience with Django forms you can become very creative in\napplications of forms. Please keep in mind that the devil is in the\ndetails, and overly creative use of forms (or anything) is a road you\nshould carefully tread. It's always good to remember that simplicity is\nbest and that the goal isn't to just write code, but to write\nmaintainable code.</p>\n<h1>Forms validate dictionaries.</h1>\n<p>One of the primary functions of any HTTP-friendly form libraries is\nvalidating dictionary-like data objects. HTTP query strings are\nkey/value structures and in order to avoid corruption in the persistence\nlayer of any project, regardless of framework or language, validation\nneeds to occur.</p>\n<p>During it's request/response cycle Django converts <code>HTTP POST</code> (and\n<code>HTTP GET</code>) objects into something called a <code>QueryDict</code>, which is an\nmerely an extended Django dictionary. See the comments in the code\nexample below for proof:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import logging\n\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom django.http.request import QueryDict\nfrom django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDict\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__main__)\n\ndef my_form_view(request):\n\n    logging.debug(\n        # logs True because request.POST is an instance of QueryDict\n        isinstance(request.POST, QueryDict)\n    )\n    logging.debug(\n        # logs True because QueryDict is a dictionary\n        issubclass(QueryDict, dict)\n    )      \n\n    return HttpResponse()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is all fine and good, but what does it mean for developers trying\nto solve problems? Well, it means that Django forms serve quite handily\nas a means for validation of dictionaries:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from myapp.forms import MyForm\n>>> good_form = MyForm({\"title\": \"Two Scoops of Django\"})\n>>> good_form.is_valid()\nTrue\n>>> good_form.errors\n{}\n>>> bad_form = MyForm({})\n>>> bad_form.is_valid()\nFalse\n>>> bad_form.errors\n{'title': [u'This field is required.']}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The power of this can't be understated. In fact, I'll be exploring\nthis particular facet of Django forms more in at least one upcoming blog\npost.</p>\n<h1>Epilogue</h1>\n<p>ModelForms adds at least three more bullets...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ModelForms render Model fields as HTML</li>\n<li>ModelForms automatically choose validators based off of Model field\ndefinitions.</li>\n<li>ModelForms save dictionaries to SQL tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>... and I touch on them in <a href=\"/core-concepts-django-modelforms.html\">my post on\nModelForms</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>One of the patterns we get positive feedback for mentioning in our\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/\">book</a> is <strong>overloading form fields</strong>.</p>\n<p>The problem this pattern handles is the use case of when we have a model\nwith a field(s) that allows for blank values, how do we force users to\nenter values?</p>\n<p>For example, assuming the following model:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)\n    age = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)\n    profession = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)\n    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>How do we make all those fields (name, age, profession, bio) required\nwithout modifying the database?</p>\n<p>This is the way I used to do it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># myapp/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=True)\n    age = forms.IntegerField(required=True)\n    profession = forms.CharField(required=True)\n    bio = forms.TextField(required=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<p>See the problems with this approach?</p>\n<p><code>MyModelForm</code> is nearly a copy of <code>MyModel</code>, and was in fact created by\ncopy/pasting model and then modifying it. In software engineering\nparlance, it violates the principal of Don't Repeat Yourself\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a>) and is\nfertile ground for introducing bugs.</p>\n<h1><code>MyModelForm</code> has a bug!</h1>\n<p>Can you spot the bug?</p>\n<p>The code example below illuminates where I purposefully/gleefully placed\nan error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class MyModel(models.Model):\n\n    # 50 character database field\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    # Most people don't write tests to check for field length.\n    # 100 character form field - probably not spotted until deployed.\n    # Easy error to make when violating DRY since the model can change\n    #   and leave the form definition behind.\n    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bugs like this happen either because developers are human and make\nmistakes, or because the model evolves over time and the forms are left\nbehind. This is a serious maintenance issue, and one that will bite you\nor the developers who end up maintaining code you've written.</p>\n<p>Can you spot the second bug? ;-)</p>\n<p>How do we fix this?</p>\n<h1>A Better Way</h1>\n<p>In instantiated Django forms, fields are kept in a dict-like object.\nWhich means, instead of writing forms in a way that duplicates the\nmodel, a better way is to explicitly modify only what we want to modify:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Making name required\n        self.fields['name'].required = True\n        self.fields['age'].required = True\n        self.fields['bio'].required = True\n        self.fields['profession'].required = True\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Other field attributes</h2>\n<p>This isn't just limited to the <code>required</code> attribute. It can also be\napplied to <code>help_text</code>, <code>label</code>, <code>choices</code>, <code>widgets</code>, or any other form\nfield attribute:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django import forms\n\nfrom .models import MyModel\n\nclass MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(MyModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # snip the other fields for the sake of brevity\n        # Adding content to the form\n        self.fields['profession'].help_text = \"Job title here\"\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyModel\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Try it with Inheritance!</h2>\n<p>We can even do this with inheritance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django import forms\n\nclass BaseEmailForm(forms.Form):\n    email = forms.EmailField(\"Email\")\n    email2 = forms.EmailField(\"Email 2\")\n\n    def clean(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        email = self.cleaned_data['email']\n        email2 = self.cleaned_data['email2']\n        if email != email2:\n            raise forms.ValidationError(\"Emails don't match\")\n        return self.cleaned_data\n\nclass ContactForm(BaseEmailForm):\n    message = forms.CharField()\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(ContactForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs):\n        self.fields['email2'].label = \"Confirm your email\"\n        self.fields['email2'].help_text = \"We want to be sure!\"\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>From the perspective of general software development, it's always a\ngood thing to avoid repeating yourself. This might seem like as much or\nin some cases even more typing, but it's a lot better than making an\nembarrassing/costly mistake.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of a Python developer our approach more closely\nmatches the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">Zen of Python</a>.\nThis is because we only modify the field properties that need to be\nmodified, the approach specified is more explicit.</p>\n<p>Today's reading is Matt Harrison's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Learning-Iteration-Generators-ebook/dp/B007JR4FCQ/?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1364400929&#x26;sr=1-5&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">Guide to Learning Iteration and\nGenerators in\nPython</a></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://blog.aclark.net/2013/12/30/new-years-python-meme-2014/\">Alex Clark's\nmeme</a>,\nhere is my own entry into this end-of-year fun.</p>\n<h1>What's the Coolest Thing You Discovered This Year?</h1>\n<p>Alex had his own focused on Python applications, frameworks, and\nlibraries. Me, I'm going for a more general approach. This year I\ndiscovered:</p>\n<h2>LaTeX</h2>\n<p>That <a href=\"dhttps://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> I co-wrote with <a href=\"https://audreyr.com\">Audrey\nRoy</a>? Written in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">LaTeX</a>. It wasn't easy to get\nstarted, even with Audrey as my instructor, but now that I grok it, I\nfeel extremely empowered. That's because I can do all kinds of awesome,\ninsane hacks when <a href=\"https://sphinx-doc.org/\">Sphinx</a> generates PDFs. I\nhope I get the chance to show off some of my new madness to the world in\n2014.</p>\n<h2>How to Tie A Bow Tie</h2>\n<p>If you are going to be formal, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie\">bow\ntie</a> adds an enormous amount of\nclass. However, clip-ons are considered tacky, especially as it's\nconsidered stylish to loosen the bow tie later in the evening to\ndemonstrate you aren't wearing that clip.</p>\n<p>Of all the stuff I watched on the subject of bow tying, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PTLV-L_sk\">this\nvideo</a> was the longest and\nthe best of them all.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1/4/2014:</strong> I learned this awesome skill because <a href=\"/i-married-audrey-roy.html\">I wanted to\nbe classy on my wedding\nday</a>.</p>\n<h2>Awesome Foods Around the World</h2>\n<p>Here's the short-list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek\">Oscypek</a> is a Polish smoked,\nsalted cheese that should be exported to the universe. Seriously. If\nyou get some, grill it and serve with jelly.</li>\n<li>In Florence, Italy you can eat Duck Carpaccio and it is heavenly. If\nthere is ever a reason to visit Florence, it is Duck Carpaccio.</li>\n<li>The Croatian King Truffle Bar is an ice cream delicacy you can find\nin any street market freezer. It's multiple shells of chocolate and\nice cream in an ice cream bar that speaks taste bud breaking volumes\nto at least the American palate.</li>\n<li>In the Philippines, they combine shaved ice, evaporated milk, purple\nyam ice cream, and tropical fruits into something they call\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo\">Halo-Halo</a>. It's\nindescribably yummy and the Los Angeles-based Jollibee version\nAnthony Bourdain tried on his show is a pale comparison to the\nfantastic treat I've been lucky enough to devour in Manila.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What New Programming Technique Did You Learn This Year?</h1>\n<p>Hard to say, but I'll go with Python's context managers. Trying to\nfind a way to have what I learned see the light of day. Love the\nclients, but this is a good reason to try and do more open source work.</p>\n<h1>Which Open Source Project Did You Contribute to the Most This Year? What Did You Do?</h1>\n<p>While I contributed nothing directly to the framework itself, between\nour book and numerous open source projects, I guess the answer is\n'Django'.</p>\n<p>In 2014 I want to switch that focus to Python.</p>\n<h1>What Are the Top Three Things You Want to Learn Next Year?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The new async framework added in Python 3.4.</li>\n<li>C because I think it will enhance my Python skills.</li>\n<li>How to be a better person. I think I educated and helped a lot of\npeople this year, but I can do better. <strong>Malcolm Tredennick</strong>\nquietly led the way, and with all the help he provided to Audrey and\nI in January for our book, we owe it to his memory to improve the\nlot of developers everywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What is the Top Thing You Wish Someone Would Write Next Year?</h1>\n<p>Something that gets more women into the top 10 of\n<a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/\">Gittip</a>. That amazing women developers and\ncommunity leaders in the Python community like <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/roguelynn/\">Lynn\nRoot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/jessicamckellar/\">Jessica\nMcKellar</a>, dare I say\n<a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/\">Audrey</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/\">Roy</a>, and others aren't up there\nspeaks uncomfortable volumes. Starting today, I'm directing all my\nGittip funds in their direction. Well... not Audrey because she won't\nlet me, but you get the idea.</p>\n<h1>What Else?</h1>\n<p>This year, 2013, was a wonderful year. Everything changed. I hope to\nhave a summary out today because some fantastically incredible things\noccurred. If not, then it will happen next year... err... tomorrow!\n;-)</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>In the summer of 2010 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fwiles\">Frank Wiles</a> of\n<a href=\"https://revsys.com\">Revsys</a> exposed me to what I later called the\n\"<strong>Easy Form Views</strong>\" pattern when creating Django form function\nviews. I used this technique in a variety of places, including <a href=\"https://www.djangopackages.com\">Django\nPackages</a> and the documentation for\ndjango-uni-form (which is rebooted as\n<a href=\"https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms\">django-crispy-forms</a>).\nAt DjangoCon 2011 <a href=\"https://tothinkornottothink.com/\">Miguel Araujo</a> and I\nopened our <a href=\"https://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/shbrd/\">Advanced Django Forms\nUsage</a> talk at DjangoCon\n2011 with this technique. It's a pattern that reduces the complexity of\nusing forms in Django function-based views by flattening the form\nhandling code.</p>\n<h1>How the Easy Form Views pattern works</h1>\n<p>Normally, function-based views in Django that handle form processing\nlook something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def my_view(request, template_name=\"my_app/my_form.html\"):\n\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        form = MyForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            do_x() # custom logic here\n            return redirect('home')\n    else:\n        form = MyForm()\n    return render(request, template_name, {'form': form})\n</code></pre>\n<p>In contrast, the Easy Form Views pattern works like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def my_view(request, template_name=\"my_app/my_form.html\"):\n\n    form = MyForm(request.POST or None)\n    if form.is_valid():\n        do_x() # custom logic here\n        return redirect('home')\n    return render(request, template_name, {'form': form})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The way this works is that the <code>django.http.HttpRequest</code> object has a\nPOST attribute that defaults to an empty dictionary-like object, even if\nthe request's method is equal to \"GET\". Since we know that\nrequest.POST exists in every Django view, and os at least as an empty\ndictionary-like object, we can skip the <code>request.method == 'POST'</code> by\ndoing a simple boolean check on the <code>request.POST</code> dictionary.</p>\n<p>In other words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>request.POST</code> dictionary evaluates as <code>True</code>, then instantiate\nthe form bound with <code>request.POST</code>.</li>\n<li>If <code>the request.POST</code> dictionary evaluates as <code>False</code>, then\ninstantiate an unbound form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Great! Faster to write and shallower code! What could possibly be wrong\nwith that?</p>\n<h1>The Controversy</h1>\n<p>Before you jump to convert all your function based forms to this\npattern, consider the following argument raised against it by a good\nfriend:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This one of those things where \"empty dictionary and null both\nevaluate as false\" can bite you.</p>\n<p>There's a difference between \"There is no POST data\", and \"This\nwasn't a POST\".</p>\n<p>-- by <a href=\"https://cecinestpasun.com/\">Russell Keith-Magee</a> (paraphrased)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem he is talking about is data besides <code>multipart/form-data</code> or\n<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> would still end up in the\n<code>request.POST</code> dictionary-like attribute.</p>\n<p>Where is the controversy? Well, I didn't write a retraction until now.\nArguably I should have done it earlier. However, since I never ran into\nthe edge case, I didn't see the need. Yet when it comes down to it, the\n\"Easy Forms\" approach has an implicit assumption about the incoming\nobject, which in Python terms is not a good thing.</p>\n<h1>Getting bit by the Easy Form Views method</h1>\n<p>Here's how it happens:</p>\n<p><strong>Before Django 1.5</strong> HTTP methods such as DELETE or PUT would see their\ndata placed into Django's <code>request.POST</code> attribute. The form would\nfail, but it might not be clear to the developer or user why. HTTP GET\nand POST methods work as expected.</p>\n<p><strong>For Django 1.5 (and later)</strong> if a non-POST comes in then the form\nfails because request.POST is empty. HTTP GET and POST methods also work\nas expected.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Going forward, I prefer to use Django's class-based views or <a href=\"https://djangorestframework.com\">Django\nRest Framework</a> which make the issue of\nthis pattern moot. When I do dip into function-based views handling\nclassic HTML forms, I'm leery of using this pattern anymore. Yes, it is\nan edge case, but to inaccurately paraphrase Russell, \"edge cases are\nwhere you get bit\".</p>\n<p>What I'm not going to do is rush to change existing views on existing\nprojects. That's because personally I've yet to run into an actual\nproblem with using this pattern. As they say, \"<em>If it ain't broke,\ndon't fix it.</em>\" While I'm not saying my code isn't broken, I'm also\naware that 'fixing' things that aren't reporting errors is a\ndangerous path to tread.</p>\n<p>Also, next time I get called on something by a person I respect, I'll\nrespond more quickly. Nearly two years is too long a wait.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Changed some of the text to be more succinct and took out\nthe leading sentence.</p>\n",

You have to\nsee it in action to believe it!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2:35 PM talks</h2>\n<p>This is a rough spot because there are four really beginner good talks\nby four great speakers happening at the same time. Since all of this are\ngoing to be wonderful presentations, I'm labeling them all as\n'must-see'.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/141/\">Who are we? A sociological analysis of the indigenous Python\ntribe</a> (Jackie\nKazil) - Journalist and computer scientist at the Library of\nCongress, Jackie Kazil uses her amazing skills to analyze the Python\ncommunity's code bases across thousands of projects to determine\nwhere we've been as a people and we are going in the future.

            "content_html": "<p>In January <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy</a> and I launched a\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> about Django called <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">Two Scoops of\nDjango: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a>. We\ndecided to not use PayPal. Here's why:</p>\n<h1>Open Source Events Get Burned By PayPal</h1>\n<p>PayPal has a long, sordid history of freezing the accounts of Python\nrelated conferences and events around the world. In fact, this article\nwas born out of the fact <a href=\"https://blog.djangocircus.com/post/43806402173/back-on-track\">DjangoCon Europe 2013 had its PayPal account\nfrozen</a>. In\nthe past, <a href=\"https://2012.djangocon.eu/\">DjangoCon Europe 2012</a>, Plone\nConferences 2008, 2011, and at least one PyCon Australia dealt with the\nsame PayPal problem (DjangoCon 2013 was forewarned and took measures to\nprotect itself). We also have unconfirmed reports of other Python and\nDjango events also running into problems with PayPal freezing accounts.\nGoing with just confirmed conferences having issues with PayPal, this is\na combined total of assets in excess of over US$100,000 dollars.</p>\n<p>It's not just a Python issue either, it's an issue that <a href=\"https://conferencesburnedbypaypal.tumblr.com/\">strikes other\nopen source languages and\ntools</a>. It's at the point\nnow where <a href=\"https://aralbalkan.com/3898/\">conference organizers don't trust\nPayPal</a> and make a point telling each other\nto use alternative payment gateways.</p>\n<h1>Fear, Shame, and PayPal</h1>\n<p>The terrifying thing to consider is that I suspect that the number of\ntechnical conferences affected by PayPal freezes is much, much larger.\nMy reasoning is that <strong>most conferences keep quiet about it</strong> because\n<strong>they're afraid that raising a fuss will annoy PayPal's anti-fraud\ndivision</strong>. Let's also face the fact that <strong>most people feel ashamed\nwhen bank accounts they are responsible for get frozen</strong>, so probably\ndon't publicize the issue.</p>\n<p>The usual way conferences deal with these lockouts is conference\norganizers beg and borrow from friends, family, take second mortgages,\nlocal banking institutions, and pray that PayPal will eventually free\ntheir account. When you deal with a hostile, inaccessible payment\ngateway who won't let you provide for the hundreds or even thousands of\npeople who paid you their hard earned money, it's the only way to get\nby.</p>\n<h1>The 'Needs' of PayPal's Anti-Fraud Division</h1>\n<p>While I could respect the needs of PayPal's anti-fraud division when\ndealing with non-fungible products like ticket sales, it's <strong>simply\nunacceptable</strong> that prominent conferences for open source projects are\ntreated this way.</p>\n<p>The software represented by these conferences drives the modern\ne-commerce world, including the myriad of systems that use PayPal to\nprocess sales. Yet PayPal continues to burn open source conferences year\nafter year, and we've never heard of any conference outreach by their\nso-called 'developer evangelists' when a conference's account is\nfrozen.</p>\n<h1>Legal recourse against PayPal is folly</h1>\n<p>Ask any lawyer and they'll basically say against PayPal you have no\noptions. PayPal has an army of lawyers and in most places isn't a bank,\nmeaning your course of action is constrained from the beginning by your\nagreeing to PayPal's Terms of Service (TOS). Also, in the United\nStates, their TOS prevents you from joining a class action lawsuit\nagainst them. Whether or not that TOS clause is enforceable in court,\nthe fact that it is in their TOS greatly reduces any faith I might have\nhad in them because it paints a picture of a company hostile to my\nneeds.</p>\n<p>In talking to authors and entrepreneurs, we've just heard (and read)\ntoo many horror stories. For merchants of non-fungible goods such as\ndigital goods like the e-book I co-authored, PayPal seems even less\ntrustworthy.</p>\n<p>Which means using PayPal places us at an unacceptable risk. We simply\ndon't have the deep pockets to deal with PayPal freezing our funds for\nsales lost from a more reliable distribution system such as\n<a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a> that powers our sales through\n<a href=\"https://gumroad.com\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<h1>It is Wrong to Use PayPal</h1>\n<p>Considering PayPal's unacceptable behavior in regards to the open\nsource community I love and merchants who try to work in their system, I\nfeel it is wrong to support PayPal. Audrey agrees, and so our policy of\nnot using PayPal to sell the book is set.</p>\n<h1>PayPal is at Risk</h1>\n<p>There was a day when Microsoft had what seemed to be an unassailable\nlock on the commercial software world. On many levels, Microsoft is a\nshadow of its former self, and I contend it wasn't just Apple's\ncompetition. Instead, Microsoft's contempt for their own customers and\nthe developer community hurt them just as much.</p>\n<p>PayPal is on the same path of self-destruction. The've gone from the\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/0977898431/?tag=ihpydanny-20\">scrappy\ncompany</a>\nhelping people grow their business to the monolithic overlord that kills\nbusinesses and well-meaning events.</p>\n<p>PayPal's demise won't happen this year, or the next, but every time\nthey damage their customer base and the developer community it's\nanother nail in the coffin. I submit that unless PayPal changes its\nways, within 5 years PayPal will be a shadow of its former self as the\narmy of growing competitors such as <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.balancedpayments.com/\">Balanced Payments</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.wepay.com/\">wepay</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://www.payoneer.com/\">Payoneer</a> expands their availability and\noptions around the world.</p>\n<h1>What PayPal Can Do for Conferences</h1>\n<p>PayPal does have to worry about ticket sales for bogus events, since\nthat separates people from their money, but identifying real conferences\nis easy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>PayPal developer evangelists and community managers need to track\nevery valid developer event in the world. It's the job of people in\nthese roles to have the connections and subject matter expertise to\nidentify real events from fake ones.</li>\n<li>PayPal needs to sponsor these events. Why? See point #3.</li>\n<li>PayPal's anti-fraud division needs to be informed that any PayPal\nsponsored event is off-limits.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What PayPal Can Do for Small Business</h1>\n<p>PayPal has its developer evangelists, community managers, and marketing\ndepartments working hard. However, at the end of the day, if you treat\nyour customers with disrespect and a lack of trust, none of that\nmatters. Bad press and market forces will see their revenues drop as\ncustomers will migrate to solutions that are more trustworthy and less\nantagonistic.</p>\n<p>I believe that PayPal needs to revise how its anti-fraud division\ncommunicates with people who have frozen accounts. They need to change\nthe adversarial pose they take with their own customers to one that is\ncollaborative.</p>\n<h1>Note</h1>\n<p>If this makes you angry as it did me, take a deep breath and step back.\nI've found <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807012394/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=0807012394&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">this\nbook</a>\nrecommended by my friend Randall Degges useful in getting back on track\nand staying productive.</p>\n",

It's been a monumental effort, a labor\nof love, and we hope you find our efforts worthy. You can buy it right\nnow in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5</a></p>\n<p>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is a compilation of\nbest practices for the Django framework. Like any framework, Django has\ntips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place.\nExperienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet\ntakes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it\ndown.</p>\n<p>We stand of the shoulders of giants: We received advice from Django\nexperts including a BDFL, Django core developers, and subject matter\nexperts from around the world. Reader contributions from advanced and\nbeginning developers have also shaped the book, and we can't thank\nenough those who gave us their insights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/\"><img src=\"/images/tsd15-beta.png\" alt=\"Beta launch image for TSD 1.5\"></a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"features\"></a>\nWhat is different about the beta release?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added 50+ pages of content while reducing the file size from 5.1 MB\nto 1.5 MB.</li>\n<li>Added list of tables, list of figures, and an index.</li>\n<li>Dramatically improved the chapters on security, testing, logging,\nadmin, and many more.</li>\n<li>Added so many more code samples that even with the new example\nnumbering system we lost count.</li>\n<li>Speaking of code examples, most of the code samples in the book are\nloaded directly out of fully tested projects.</li>\n<li>Incorporated the feedback of dozens of readers. Thank you so much\nfor your contributions!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What does buying the beta get me?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Access the PDF version of the book.</li>\n<li>Access to the Kindle and ePub formats when we release the final.</li>\n<li>Access to final release of the book.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Why aren't there Kindle or ePub versions yet?</h1>\n<p>We want to support more formats, but won't do it poorly. It's going to\ntake us at least several days to render the book in an alternative\nformat that looks good. Since we both have multiple presentations at the\nupcoming <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon US</a>, we simply don't have\ntime to get it done.</p>\n<h1>If I bought the alpha do I have to buy the beta?</h1>\n<p>Alpha buyers get full access the beta. In fact, you should have already\nreceived an email with a link to the latest version. If that hasn't\narrived, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com\">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a>.</p>\n<h1>Is this book good for beginners?</h1>\n<p>The response from beginning Django developers reading it has been\n<strong>unbelievably, overwhelmingly positive</strong>. This is the book we wanted to\nhave when we learned Django, and we're honored by the response the book\nhas received.</p>\n<p>Since the book isn't a tutorial, we ask that before beginners purchase\nit, they <a href=\"https://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">learn the fundamentals of</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">Python</a>\nand take the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/\">official Django\ntutorial</a>.</p>\n<p>When beginners find sections of the book above their head, they do what\neveryone does when reading a technical reference: skip over challenging\nsections until they have enough grounding to understand.</p>\n<p>If any beginners are confused by our explanations, or have difficulties,\nplease email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com\">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. We'll do our best to\nanswer your questions. Your issues provide invaluable insight into what\nwe need to improve.</p>\n<h1>Is this book good for experienced developers?</h1>\n<p>We've done our best to provide worthwhile material for developers of\nall levels. In fact, a lot of intermediate to advanced developers have\nsaid they've found good things to use in our book. Many have also found\nthat by using our book as a supplementary manual, it helps them their\nteam work better.</p>\n<h1>Is this book going to get updated?</h1>\n<p>Absolutely!</p>\n<p>During the <strong>alpha</strong> we updated the book multiple times before knuckling\ndown on the <strong>beta</strong> rewrite. Even after the final version comes out,\nwe'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of\nself-published e-books is we have total control of content.</p>\n<h1>When can I get a print version?</h1>\n<p>After a lot of consideration, we've decided to hold off on the print\nversion of the book until what we call the\n<a href=\"/two-scoops-beta-released.html#final\">final</a>\nrelease, which won't be released until after <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon\nUS</a>. We're very finicky and don't want\nbuyers of the print version to have an unfinished book.</p>\n<h1>Tutorial? PyCon? Are you going?</h1>\n<p>Yes! We're going to be at PyCon next month! We're giving the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/\">Wiring\nUp Django Packages</a>\ntutorial, and <a href=\"https://brack3t.com/\">Kenneth Love</a> (of <a href=\"https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/\">Getting Started\nwith Django</a> fame) is part of our\nteam.</p>\n<p>While tickets to PyCon itself are sold out, you can still <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/\">register for\nthe tutorials</a>.</p>\n<h1>When is the book's final release?</h1>\n<p>The final release won't occur until after PyCon.</p>\n<p>Our plan for the final release of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices\nfor Django 1.5 is to focus on errata, alternative electronic formats,\nand the print version.</p>\n<h1>Can we purchase the book in bulk?</h1>\n<p>We're working on a program to provide organizations the capability to\npurchase many e-copies and keep the recipients of the book updated\nconstantly. We hope to have this ready in a few days.</p>\n<h1>Can I buy the book via PayPal?</h1>\n<p>No. I've answered in full\n<a href=\"/we-are-not-using-paypal.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We're considering other non-credit card options to handle payment.</p>\n<h1>Known Issue Warnings</h1>\n<h2>Copy/Paste</h2>\n<p>There are problems with copy/pasting of code from the PDF. The new build\nprocess is turning the code examples into some sort of image type of\nobject, which explains the strange characters. We're working on it, but\naren't sure how long the fix will take.</p>\n<h2>Android</h2>\n<p>On Android, if you try to open the PDF directly from the Gumroad\ndownload, you might get a \"Cannot open file\" error; however, if you\nnavigate to the download location on your phone/tablet with a file\nbrowser (e.g. Samsung's \"My Files\"), you should be able to open the\nfile from there. Gumroad is currently investigating the issue.</p>\n<h1>Where should I send errata or suggestions?</h1>\n<p>Please send errata to <a href=\"mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com\">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. We try to respond\npersonally to every request.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>This is Part II in a series of blog posts about <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon US\n2013</a>. The goal is to provide a handy\nreference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest\n<a href=\"https://python.org\">Python</a> conference. <a href=\"/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html\">Part\nI</a> was\nmostly about <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/\">tutorials</a>,\nthis post will be about registration and the first day of talks.</p>\n<h1>Registration</h1>\n<p>If you haven't done so yet, please\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/\">register</a> now. Last\nyear PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which\nis a shame, because the conference is awesome!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a\nvery good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are\nsubtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software\nFoundation (<a href=\"https://python.org/psf/\">PSF</a>). In addition to supporting\nthe Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants\nfor aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you\nspend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives. This\nisn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a difference for\nyou, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more, but that's\nan article for another day...</p>\n<p>Alright, on to the talks!</p>\n<h1>Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>\n<p>At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and\nbrightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some\nquick guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions at the\nend, <a href=\"https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/\">go and\nask</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's disconcerting to\ngive a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable\nelectronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using\nelectronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning\nthem off to look at the speaker.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of\nhundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video.\nHeckling is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and\nmake enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the\ntalk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March\n15th, has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...</p>\n<h2>Friday Morning</h2>\n<p>The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM.\nFrom 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches.\nPyCon keynotes aren't boring - <strong>they are crazy awesome!</strong>.</p>\n<p>In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical\nones.</p>\n<h3>10:50 AM talks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/35/\">How to Except When You're\nExcepting</a>\n(Esther Nam) - One of the rising stars of the community, Esther\nworks for a group that demands 100% test coverage.

            "content_html": "<p>New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon\nUS</a> for the first time? You know, that big\n<a href=\"https://python.org\">Python</a> conference taking place near San Francisco\nin March?</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being\noverwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?</p>\n<p>No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out\nof attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm\ngoing to share how to get through the whole event in good shape and\ncover some incredible beginner friendly events.</p>\n<h1>The Basics</h1>\n<p>First off, <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/\">register</a>\nalready! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left\nout in the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!</p>\n<p>Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/\">tutorials</a>, three days\nof <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/\">talks</a>, and four days of\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/\">sprints</a>. <strong>Nine days of\nPython!</strong> The trick is to not get exhausted or sick. Therefore, do the\nfollowing every day of the conference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take at least one shower. Please.</li>\n<li>Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different\npeople at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!</li>\n<li>Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your\nbrain is going to go into learning overdrive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, PyCon US also has a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/\">code of\nconduct</a>. I like to\nsum it up as, \"Act professionally.\" Whether or not you agree with\ncodes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be\nenforced.</p>\n<p>Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!</p>\n<h1>Tutorials</h1>\n<p>Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but\nare well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best\nsuited for beginners.</p>\n<h2>Wednesday Morning</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>For novice programmers start with Jessica McKellar's <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/1/\">A hands-on\nintroduction to Python for beginning\nprogrammers</a>. I\ncan vouch that the instructor is amazing, and will jumpstart you on\nthe road to being a Python developer.</li>\n<li>Are you an experienced developer new to Python? I suggest <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/8/\">Going\nfrom web pages to web apps with\nPython</a> by\nAsheesh Loroia and Karen Rustad. In 2009 I took a class by Asheesh\nand was impressed by his energy, enthusiasm, and depth of knowledge.</li>\n<li>Want to learn Python web that isn't Django? Try out Paul Everitt's\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/12/\">Pyramid for\nHumans</a> class.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Wednesday Afternoon</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>You simply can't go wrong with David Beazley's <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/2/\">Learn Python\nThrough Public Data\nHacking</a>. He's\nthe author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">Python Essential\nReference</a>,\nan amazing instructor, and delivered a PyCon keynote last year.</li>\n<li>If you're interested in the web, check out Nathan Yergler's\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/9/\">Effective\nDjango</a>. I can\nassure you that he knows his Django material and is going to deliver\na great experience.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Thursday Morning</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>If you're new to Python, you need to learn the Python environment.\nThis means version control, PyPI, test automation, and more. Matt\nHarrison covers this in <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/3/\">Scripting: from Hard-drive to Github to\nPyPI</a></li>\n<li>Getting back to the web, <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/10/\">Fully Test-Driven Web Development with\nDjango and\nSelenium</a> is\nanother run through the Django tutorial, but done from the test\ndriven perspective.</li>\n<li>A fascinating tutorial offered at this time is <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/30/\">A Gentle\nIntroduction to Computer\nVision</a>. It's\na great way to learn how Python is used in many creative and\nunexpected ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Thursday Afternoon</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Jessica McKellar returns to instruct on how to give back to the\ncommunity with <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/4/\">Contribute with me! Getting started with open source\ndevelopment</a>.</li>\n<li>Want to learn how to program games? Look no further than Richard\nJones' <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/19/\">Introduction to\nPyGame</a>. He's\ntaught this class for years, and I can't say enough good things\nabout him.</li>\n<li>This talk is not meant for beginning Django developers, but it's\nuseful anyway. <a href=\"https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/\">Kenneth Love</a>\nand <a href=\"https://jacobian.org\">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> are presenting <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/\">Wiring\nUp Django\nPackages</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Evening Activities</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/reception/\">Opening Reception</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part II</h1>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-2.html\">Beginner's Guide to PyCon 2013 Part\nII</a> where I\ncover the first day of talks best suited for new Python developers!</p>\n",

The response\nhas been almost entirely positive and sales have been pretty brisk.\nWe've gotten a ton of great, constructive editorial feedback, which\nwe're sorting through as we race towards the BETA release. Here are\nanswers to the commonly asked questions:</p>\n<h2>When can I buy the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> via PayPal?</h2>\n<p>We now support PayPal. The next part is the historical text that no longer applies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to handle PayPal we need to find a reputable e-publisher that supports it that gives us similar rates, customer service, and product control (updates at any time, uploads of PDF, no surprise charges, etc) as <a href=\"https://gumroad.com\">Gumroad</a>. If you know of an e-publisher who is willing to provide that same level of service, please let me know.</p>\n<p>For the record, we aren't leaving <a href=\"https://gumroad.com\">Gumroad</a>. We just want to support developers and students who don't have credit cards.</p>\n<p><strong>note:</strong> While we could certainly write our own publishing platform, that would delay work on the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a>. ;-)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>When can I get a Kindle (mobi) or ePub version?</h2>\n<p>Our plan is to support those formats in either the BETA or FINAL\nreleases. In fact, I really love my\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=ihpydanny-20\">Kindle</a>.\nI can't wait to proof my own <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> on my\nfavorite reading device.</p>\n<h2>When can I get a print version?</h2>\n<p>We hope to have a print version in about 30 days. We need to ensure that\nthe cover and layout actually looks nice, and that involves ordering\ncopies from the Lulu, CreateSpace, whatever and reviewing them and\nmaking corrections. Then ordering again to make sure the corrections\nlook okay. That simply takes a lot of time.</p>\n<p>We are hoping for a mid-February release. Also, keep in mind we aren't\nsure yet if we'll do a print version of anything but a FINAL release.</p>\n<h2>When are the BETA and FINAL releases?</h2>\n<p>As soon as possible.</p>\n<p>We can't make promises, but at the latest, the FINAL <em>should</em> be done\nby the start of March so people have them in hand at PyCon US.</p>\n<h2>Is this book going to get updated?</h2>\n<p>Absolutely!</p>\n<p>In fact, we've already sent out three minor updates for grammar and\nspelling issues, and some bug fixes. Even after the FINAL version comes\nout, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of\nself-published books is we have control of content.</p>\n<h2>How much work went into the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a>?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey</a> and I put in hundreds of hours writing\nand testing the content. We worked 12-16 hour days for weeks. It was\nmadness, but a glorious madness. We became like hermits and toiled on\nthe <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> while ignoring distractions like\nsleep, food and consistent exercise.</p>\n<p>Our amazing technical reviewers also worked very hard to provide us with\ncritical commentary, advice and corrections.</p>\n<h2>Where should I send errata?</h2>\n<p>Please send errata to <a href=\"mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com\">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>. The first person who\nreports an issue or makes a suggestion that we adopt will receive credit\nin the book. If not in the changelog, then in the dialogue of the book\nitself.</p>\n<h2>Are you going to PyCon US?</h2>\n<p>Absolutely! Wouldn't miss <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon US</a> for\nthe world! <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/\">Audrey</a> and I met and fell in love at\nPyCon US 2010! We'll be there for at least the second day of tutorials,\nall the talks, and all the\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/\">sprints</a>. I've even got\na blog post coming that should serve as a guide for beginning Python and\nDjango developers attending the event.</p>\n<p><em>Shameless Plug:</em> We're both speaking and giving a tutorial. Sign up\nfor the tutorial or attend our talks!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/\">Wiring Up Django Packages</a> (Tutorial)</h3>\n<p>You just finished the Django tutorial. What do you do now? You wire in\nDjango Packages! Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages,\nwhich can be leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the\nevaluation, use, and extension of third party Python and Django\napplications in your projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a\nlot of detailed and annotated code examples. Instructors are <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/\">Audrey\nRoy Greenfeld</a>, Daniel Roy Greenfeld, and <a href=\"https://brack3t.com/\">Kenneth\nLove</a> (of <a href=\"https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/\">Getting Started with\nDjango</a> fame).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/101/\">Advanced Django Forms Usage</a> (Talk)</h2>\n<p>Django forms are really powerful but there are edge cases, especially\nwith class based views), that can cause a bit of anguish. This talk will\ngo over how to handle many common solutions not currently described in\nthe core documentation. It will also cover useful third-party libraries.\nSpeaker is Daniel Roy Greenfeld.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/\">Using Python To Generate Art And Sound</a> (Talk)</h2>\n<p>The trick to navigating the overwhelming Python audio/imaging landscape\nis understanding how the fundamentals work, using common data\nprocessing/visualization libraries, in-depth code samples, and simple\nmath operations. I use the stdlib, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PIL, and\nPyCairo to create building blocks, which I then combine to demonstrate\nadvanced sound and image generation techniques. Speaker is <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey\nRoy Greenfeld</a>.</p>\n<h2>Are you going to Django Circus?</h2>\n<p>We hope so. <a href=\"https://2013.djangocon.eu/\">Django Circus</a>, a.k.a. DjangoCon\nEurope, is one of the important industry events for us and we're trying\nto figure out logistics.</p>\n<p>Our problem is that 2012 was a very hard year - the majority of our\nclients have not paid for the work that we did. Collecting is turning\nout to be extremely difficult, time consuming, and unpleasant. This is\nimpacting everything we want to do in 2013.</p>\n<h2>How does the ALPHA work?</h2>\n<p>The ALPHA is a preview version that we are selling at an introductory\nprice of $12. When you purchase the ALPHA, you get access to the BETA\nand FINAL versions when they are released.</p>\n<p>In case you're wondering, we are planning to increase the price of the\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> when we release the BETA and FINAL\nversions.</p>\n",

Experienced developers know this stuff, but\ngleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take\neverything we know and write it down. This\n<a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> reflects a portion of what we\ndocumented, and if it does well we plan to follow it up with other\nreferences.</p>\n<p>If you've followed this blog or watched our talks you've know we've\nexplained tons of Django and Python related examples. We enjoy using\nDjango and Python to build stable, fast web applications quickly and\nefficiently. This is the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> we would have\nwanted while learning the intricacies of our tools, and then kept it\nhandy for reference.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5\">book</a> we cover everything from\ncustomizing the Django 1.5 User model, forms, views, templates,\nsecurity, bottleneck analysis and so much more. We tie in third-party\npackages from the Django and Python community. We discuss the positive\npatterns that allow for rapid development, and point out the\nanti-patterns that cause problems. The result isn't a walk-through or\ntutorial, but a reference guide for anyone with at least a basic\nunderstanding of Django.</p>\n<p>We tried to make the code copy/pastable, but we are constrained by the\nlimits of PDF. While the code examples display nicely, <em>when pasting\nfrom Adobe Reader the leading white spaces vanish</em>. We apologize and ask\nif anyone knows how to address this issue to let us know at\n<a href=\"mailto:hello@roygreenfeld.com\">hello@roygreenfeld.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Even with an amazing cadre of technical reviewers, there is always the\npossibility of errors.

It was a toss-up between these three\nchoices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Django Class Based Views (CBVs) allow developers do amazing things\nwith Django, but needed some polish (<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/\">improved\ndocumentation</a>,\n<a href=\"https://django-braces.readthedocs.org/\">missing functionality</a>) to\nbe able to shine.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reportlab.org\">ReportLab</a> for generating PDF allowed me to\ncreate some <a href=\"https://www.petcheatsheets.com/\">impressive results</a>,\nbut the API needed updating.

While that didn't do my\nego any favors, it was a nice refreshing reminder not to get arrogant\nabout one's skills.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?\n=====================================================================================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer to this is <strong>Django</strong>.</p>\n<p>After using Django professionally for 2.5 years, I finally began\ncontributing to the core framework at the DjangoCon Eu 2012 sprints. I\njoined a group of other dedicated people who decided to improve the\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/\">Django CBV\ndocumentation</a>,\nour goal being setting a new standard for documentation. I'm not sure\nif we set a new bar in documentation, but we did improve on the existing\nmaterial.</p>\n<p>I branched out into some other areas of core Django development with\nmixed results, which played out that way because I just didn't have the\ntime to do more.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?\n==============================================================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As always, <a href=\"https://planet.python.org\">https://planet.python.org</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?\n===========================================================</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Really advanced Python as taught by Raymond Hettiger or David\nBeazley.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I really want to learn <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/\">Twisted</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to do an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%BA#A.C3.BA\">Aú sem\nMão</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013?\n=========================================================================================</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've got a couple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Python SDK that produces results that work perfectly for both\nmodern iOS and Android.

And any creative type.</p>\n<p>As of December 7th, 2012, it had been retweeted over 500 times, a\npersonal best. Obviously I struck a chord that resonated with a lot of\npeople.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Developers should have 4-6 hours of uninterrupted activity each day. Each 3-5 minute interruption costs more than you can imagine.</p>&mdash; Daniel Greenfeld (@pydanny) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydanny/status/275680738773463040\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-03T19:19:44+00:00\">December 3, 2012</a></blockquote>\n<script src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\nWhy did this tweet resonate with so many people?\n================================================\n<p>What I said in that tweet was not new - dozens if not hundreds of others\nhave tweeted similar thoughts before and gotten many retweets. Heck,\nit's been written about in blogs and articles for years, either as a\nhuge rant or often as an effort to politely educate others on how to set\nup a developer/operations/creative shop.</p>\n<p>I think this is because developers/engineers/creatives (and good\nmanagers) know that even a tiny distraction to someone \"in the zone\"\ntakes more than just the 3-5 minutes it takes for you to finish a\nquestion and get an answer. Plus, because you are trying to remember the\npieces in your head, you won't be able to give this issue your full\nattention. Which causes a whole other set of issues.</p>\n<p>We know this. Good managers know this. Good companies live off of it.</p>\n<p>And yet this remains a huge problem for many of us because the\ndistractions keep happening. Maybe it's because your manager doesn't\nunderstand this issue, or you have a team mate who can switch in-and-out\nof the zone with impunity. Or because you foolishly leave the\nchat/IRC/phone on and you get pinged.</p>\n<h1>How do we fix it?</h1>\n<p><strong>We can't.</strong></p>\n<p>I know this sounds depressing, but I'm being realistic. Here's some\nreasons that apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unless you are fortunate enough to be working on a solo effort, you\nare working with other developers/engineers/creatives. And if they\ncan't ask you questions or inform you about critical stuff then you\nor they can waste hours.</li>\n<li>Meetings, short or long, online or in person, are a necessary part\nof any operation. If not with your boss or underlings, then with\nclients or users.</li>\n<li>Your boss/co-workers/underlings/kids/pets/parents don't get it that\nyou can't be interrupted.</li>\n<li>As a freelancer, you can't be inaccessible to existing or potential\nclients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>No really, how do we fix it?</h1>\n<p>Doesn't matter how frequently you ask the the question (or rant about\nit), I don't believe this problem can be really solved. However, here\nare some possible mitigations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Maker's Day</strong></p>\n<p>My friend, <a href=\"https://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day/\">Craig\nKerstiens</a>\ndescribes how <a href=\"https://heroku.com\">Heroku</a> gives engineers a full day\neach week (Thursday) to focus on getting stuff done. No meetings, no\nstandup, just 100% uninterrupted quiet time to focus on making stuff.</p>\n<p>Suggest this at your company and see how it goes!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Blocks of Time</strong></p>\n<p>As of 2010, <a href=\"https://eldarion.com\">Eldarion</a> broke up their work day into\nat least two sizable chunks of uninterrupted activity. Between the\nchunks you communicated with co-workers. The advantage of this approach\nis if you went down the wrong path or someone had a critical question,\nthe period between chunks addressed this issue.</p>\n<p>In theory this is how a lot of places work (lunch being the break). The\nreality is that the distractions often still pile in. For Eldarion it\nworked because everyone was remote.</p>\n<p><strong>3. New Desk Location</strong></p>\n<p>If working at an office, asked to be moved to a place with less foot\ntraffic. The downside to this is you can end up in noisy, cold, dark\nplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>4. New Job</strong></p>\n<p>Switch to a new job that promises less distractions.</p>\n<h1>Maybe I'm wrong</h1>\n<p>I'm more than happy to be proven wrong.</p>\n<p>Maybe there is a way to get 4-6 hours a day of uninterrupted maker's\ntime every work day.</p>\n<p>If you've got any ideas, let me know!</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>One virtue of Django Class Based Views (CBVs) is that they come with\npretty good default settings. The virtue of this is you can really pare\nyour code down in size and complexity.</p>\n<p>For example, here is an implementation of CBVs based on a\nstraight-forward Django model , <code>stuffage.models.Stuff</code>, that has a\n<code>get_absolute_url</code> method:</p>\n<p><strong>stuffage/views.py</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.views import generic\n\nfrom stuffage.models import Stuff\n\nclass StuffDetailView(generic.DetailView):\n    model = Stuff\n\nclass StuffListView(generic.ListView):\n    model = Stuff\n\nclass StuffCreateView(generic.CreateView):\n    model = Stuff\n\nclass StuffUpdateView(generic.UpdateView):\n    model = Stuff\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>stuffage/urls.py</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url, include\n\nfrom stuffage import views\n\nurlpatterns = patterns(\"\",\n\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^create/$\",\n        view=views.StuffCreateView.as_view(),\n        name=\"stuff_create\",\n    ),\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^update/(?P&#x3C;pk>\\d+)/$\",\n        view=views.StuffUpdateView.as_view(),\n        name=\"stuff_update\",\n    ),\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^(?P&#x3C;pk>\\d+)/$\",\n        view=views.StuffDetailView.as_view(),\n        name=\"stuff_detail\",\n    ),\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^$\",\n        view=views.StuffListView.as_view(),\n        name=\"stuff_list\",\n    ),\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>These four CBVs will default to the following three templates without\nany action on my part:</p>\n<pre><code>stuffage/stuff_detail.html (StuffDetailView)\nstuffage/stuff_form.html (StuffCreateView, StuffUpdateView)\nstuffage/stuff_list.html (StuffListView)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So easy I use a simple script to render all this code!</p>\n<h1>What about doing this all in the urls.py?</h1>\n<p>Yes, I could do this all in the urls.py, but real Django code involves\ndoing some logic in views, no matter how skinny you try to make said\nviews. While I'm a huge proponent of logic in fat models, invariably\nI'm adding to the view context, or doing something else that requires\ntweaking of CBV settings.</p>\n<h1>The problem</h1>\n<p>One trait of developers is we like to <strong>tinker</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I keep seeing developers tinkering on the settings for\nDjango CBVs without any reason besides tinkeringWhich means you get\nthings like:</p>\n<p><strong>unfortunately tinkered stuffage/views.py</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># 1. Using template_name means extra code and extra developer lookup time.\n# 2. Changing the context_object_name means extra code  and extra developer     \n#       lookup time.\nclass StuffDetailView(generic.DetailView):\n    model = Stuff\n    template_name = \"stuffage/stuffs.html\"\n    context_object_name = 'stuff'\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>unfortunately tinkered stuffage/urls.py</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># 1. Logic into your URLConf should be kept to a minimum\n# 2. Unless you are using the same view more than once, specifying the\n#       template_name here is a waste of code. And makes it harder to\n#       understand the view.\nurl(\n    regex=r\"^$\",\n    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(template_name=\"stuffage/stuffs.html\"),\n    name=\"stuff_list\",\n),\n\n# No matter how fat your models get, you always end up extending all views,\n#   so this will have to be moved into the formal views.py at some point. So\n#   why not start with it in the views.py in the first place.\nurl(\n    regex=r\"^$\",\n    view=ListView.as_view(\n        model=Stuff,\n        template_name=\"stuffage/stuffs.html\"),\n    name=\"stuff_list\",\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don't forget you can also tinker/tweak formats and slug/pk identifier\ndefaults, and a ton of other things that are part of Django CBVs. While\nthis gives you great power, if misused that power can cause grief in\nterms of code obfuscation and the need for additional testing.</p>\n<p>My opinion is that these defaults were meant as a standard for the CBV\nto operate, upon which developers familiar with the Django CBV API could\nextend and expand their code for minimal effort. Yes, you can tweak them\nto match your preferred patterns, but that's extra work. Work you\nshouldn't be doing if you can avoid it.</p>\n<h1>My Advice</h1>\n<p>Stick with the defaults and only modify behavior that actually needs to\nbe modified. For example, if you want to show multiple versions of a\nListView you might do something like:</p>\n<p><strong>stuffage/urls.py with a pydanny approved use of template_name</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">url(\n    regex=r\"^$\",\n    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(),\n    name=\"stuff_list\",\n),\n\n# Same view but with a template designed to show larger list items.\nurl(\n    regex=r\"^large/$\",\n    view=views.StuffListView.as_view(template_name=\"stuffage/stuff_list_large.html\"),\n    name=\"stuff_list_large\",\n),\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>This is the pattern I follow when I build projects. I stick to the\nframework standard as much as possible. Since many systems rely on\nconvention over configuration, this makes it easier and faster to\ndevelop projects, be it Django, Twisted, or some other tool.</p>\n<p>It's the work you can see in my <a href=\"https://petcheatsheets.com\">recent</a>\n<a href=\"https://movehero.io\">public</a> <a href=\"https://lacurrents.com\">projects</a>, and what\nI want to port to long existing sites like <a href=\"https://djangopackages.com\">Django\nPackages</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Backstory:</strong> On Saturday, November 17, 2012 Audrey\nRoy and I decided to participate in the\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/petcentric\">Petcentric</a> hackathon, a Los Angeles\narea Pet-themed product/coding contest held at\n<a href=\"https://www.amplify.la/\">Amplify</a>. We arrived a bit late, but armed with\nAudrey's idea of creating a pet based reference sheet for owners, pet\nsitters, vets, and anyone else needing a card with data on pets, we got\nto work. About eight hours later we toggled a DNS switch and\n<a href=\"https://www.petcheatsheets.com\">petcheatsheets.com</a> was live.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Pet Cheatsheet's owner's pet information is private,\nbecause it includes emergency contact information that often includes\nphone numbers, email addresses, and even physical addresses of family\nmembers and friends. Maintaining the privacy of pets and their owners\nwas also a consideration in implementation.</p>\n<h1>URL Design Thoughts</h1>\n<p>During development, one of the things I considered carefully was URL\ndesign of the primary feature, which was pets. The obvious choice was to\ngo with a design that identified owners with pets:</p>\n<pre><code>/&#x3C;owner_username>/&#x3C;pet_name>/\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, upon reflection, this didn't sit well with me. What if a pet\nchanged owners? Identifying a pet with a particular owner in the URL\nmeant that if we ever added a 'transfer ownership' feature, there\nwould be extra work. Also, if we ever implemented a sharing feature,\nchanging URLs on a pet going to the same veterinarian their whole life\nmight make the veterinarian's list of pets and their URLs invalid.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I decided to go with an identifier and pet name,\nwhere the pet name was actually not used in the lookup:</p>\n<pre><code>/&#x3C;pet_id>/&#x3C;pet_name:not_required>/\n</code></pre>\n<p>One more thing, rather than just use the <strong>pet</strong> table's primary key as\n<code>&#x3C;pet_id></code> I decided to go with base36 (0-9 and a-z) encoding. It's not\nunlike what URL shortening services do, and if we gained any traction,\nit makes recitation of a pet's URL easier. So the final result was\nactually:</p>\n<pre><code>/&#x3C;pet_id:base_36_encoded>/&#x3C;pet_name:not_required>/\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Here's a simplified view of the final implementation, starting with the\nmodel:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># pets/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\n\nclass Pet(models.Model):\n\n    name = models.CharField(_(\"Pet's name\"), max_length=100)\n    identifier = models.CharField(_(\"identifier\"), max_length=50,\n        null=True, blank=True, db_index=True)\n    # More fields...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the form:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># pets/forms.py\nfrom django import forms\n\nfrom pets.models import Pet\n\nclass PetForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Pet\n        fields = ('name', ) # more fields\n</code></pre>\n<p>With model and form, we build the views:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># pets/views.py\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404\nfrom django.utils.baseconv import base36\nfrom django.views.generic import CreateView, DetailView, UpdateView\n\nfrom braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin\n\nfrom pets.forms import PetForm\n\nclass PetCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):\n\n    model = Pet\n    form_class = PetForm\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        pet = form.save()\n        pet.identifier = base36.encode(pet.pk)\n        pet.owner = self.request.user\n        # Save again - it's not taking THAT many server cycles AND we needed\n        #    the pet.pk in advance to generate the pet.identifier\n        pet.save()\n        return super(PetCreateView, self).form_valid(form)\n\n\nclass GetPetMixin(object):\n    \"\"\" Any view that needs to get a Pet object can use this Mixin\n\n        Pet Cheatsheet's owner's pet information is private, because it\n            includes emergency contact information that often includes phone\n            numbers, email addresses, and even physical addresses of family\n            members and friends.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_object(self):\n        pet = get_object_or_404(Pet, identifier=self.kwargs['identifier'])\n\n        if pet.owner != self.request.user:\n            # Rather than a 'forbidden' result, we want to show a 'Pet Not\n            #    Found' page so we can educate site users.\n            raise Http404\n        return pet\n\nclass PetDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, DetailView):\n    pass\n\nclass PetUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, UpdateView):\n    model = Pet\n    form_class = PetForm\n\nclass PetPDFView(LoginRequiredMixin, GetPetMixin, DetailView):\n    model = Pet\n\n    # snip: lots of code for rendering the PDFs.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we wire up the views into the urls:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url\n\nfrom pets import views\n\nurlpatterns = patterns(\"\",\n\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^build-cheatsheet/$\",\n        view=views.PetCreateView.as_view(),\n        name=\"pet_create\",\n    ),\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^update/(?P&#x3C;identifier>[\\w\\d]+)/(?P&#x3C;slug>[\\w\\d\\-\\_]+)/$\",\n        view=views.PetUpdateView.as_view(),\n        name=\"pet_update\",\n    ),\n    url(\n        regex=r\"^(?P&#x3C;identifier>[\\w\\d]+)/(?P&#x3C;slug>[\\w\\d\\-\\_]+)/$\",\n        view=views.PetDetailView.as_view(),\n        name=\"pet_detail\",\n    ),\n    # snip: a lot of other views\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p>In the image below you can see how Marko's URL has his own unique\nidentifier, along with his name. I can change the name in the URL or\neven in the database, but so long as I don't modify the identifying\npart of the URL (<code>1m</code>), his information always shows up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/petcheatsheets-url-example.png\" alt=\"image\">]</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Today I decided to use the Django class based view (CBV) CreateView, but\nI wanted to avoid duplications and submit to the view from the front\npage of a site. The reason was I needed a simple newsletter signup form.\nThis is what I cooked up and should work for Django 1.3, 1.4, and the\nforthcoming 1.5 release. Here is what I did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installed dependencies\n=========================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version requires the following package to be pip installed into\nyour virtualenv.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions\">django-extensions</a>\nso we can have easy timestamps on models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This also needs to be added to your list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">INSTALLED_APPS += (\n    'django_extensions',\n)\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Defined the model\n====================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The model is really simple, and inherits from TimeStampedModel so we\nknow when people signed up:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.db import models\n\nfrom django_extensions.db.models import TimeStampedModel\n\nclass NewsLetterSignup(TimeStampedModel):\n\n    email = models.EmailField(\"Email\")\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.email\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Wrote the view\n=================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's the somewhat challenging part that forced me to dive into\nDjango's source code. Even with the documentation work we've done over\nthe past few months, it's clear we've got a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Because of that source code diving, for this blog post I really did my\nbest to document why I did things in the\n<code>NewsLetterSignupView.form_valid()</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.views.generic import CreateView\n\nfrom .models import NewsLetterSignup\n\nclass NewsLetterSignupView(CreateView):\n    \"\"\" Signs up users to a newsletter \"\"\"\n\n    model = NewsLetterSignup\n    success_url = '/newsletter-signed-up/'  # replace with reverse\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        \"\"\"\n        If the form is valid, save the associated model.\n            (django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin)\n        If the form is valid, redirect to the supplied URL.\n            (django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin)\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Get the email from the form.cleaned_data dictionary\n        email = form.cleaned_data.get(\"email\", \"\")\n\n        # Get or create the signup. We don't need to do anything with the\n        #   model instance or created boolean so we don't set them.\n        NewsLetterSignup.objects.get_or_create(email=email)  \n\n        # Don't use super() to inherit as it will do a form.save()\n        # You could call the FormMixin's form_valid() method but I think    \n        #   using a HttpResponseRedirect() much more explicit.\n        return HttpResponseRedirect(self.success_url)  \n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Wired it together\n====================</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In urls.py:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.conf.urls import patterns, url\nfrom django.views.generic import TemplateView\n\nfrom .views import NewsLetterSignupView\n\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    url(regex=r'^newsletter-signed-up/$',\n        view=TemplateView.as_view(\n            template_name=\"pages/newsletter_signed_up.html\"\n        ),\n        name='newsletter_signedup',\n    ),\n    url(regex=r'^newsletter-signup/$',\n        view=NewsLetterSignupView.as_view(),\n        name='news_letter_signup',\n    ),\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>\n<p>First off, you'll notice I didn't include the\n<code>pages/newsletter_signed_up.html</code> because for this case it's too\ntrivial.</p>\n<p>Second, this is one of those very clear cases where a functional view\nwould have been so much easier compared to the effort I spent writing\nthis as a class based view. The line count would have been about the\nsame, but the mental bandwidth involved in figuring this would have been\na fraction of the effort I spent.</p>\n<p>Third, this is probably better served with an implementation of\n<code>django.views.generic.FormView</code>. Oh well...</p>\n<p>Fourth, I want to see a configurable version of this in the next release\nof <a href=\"https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/\">django-braces</a>. ;-)</p>\n",

They'll\nbe joined by dozens of either really smart coders or nice people like\nme. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and more!</p>\n<p>RSVP at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/\">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/</a></p>\n<p>I'll be there to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-lead the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles\ntechnical community!</li>\n<li>Code like a fiend. I plan to work on core\n<a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a>. Maybe some ember.js stuff too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>\n<h2>When and where?</h2>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<pre><code>Cross Campus (crosscamp.us)\n820 Broadway\nSanta Monica, CA\n</code></pre>\n<p>When:</p>\n<pre><code>November 4th, 2012\n10 AM to 9 PM\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Is this like a Hackathon?</h2>\n<p>Yup. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints</a></p>\n<h2>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</h2>\n<p>Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join\nand contribute to in order to make the world a better place. The current\nlist of projects include things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Django - in fact, this time we've got at least one core Django\ndeveloper!</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Rails</li>\n<li>Ruby</li>\n<li>Pyramid</li>\n<li>Salt Stack</li>\n<li>Clojure</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?</h2>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p><strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place. Instead,\nyou might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In\nfact, here's a good <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/\">bi-weekly hack night / study\ngroup</a> for you.</p>\n<p><strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great way to\nlearn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced\ndevelopers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are\ncalled 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for\nbeginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at\nevents like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other\nthings that have made me a better coder.</p>\n<h2>Can I come and do one of the following:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recruit.</li>\n<li>Get people to work on my private project.</li>\n<li>Get people to work on my start-up idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>No.</strong></p>\n<p>This is not a job fair or way to get free developers services, and we\ndon't want unnecessary distractions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we mention you on the\nofficial event description, in social media and many other perks. To bad this event occured years ago.</p>\n<p>In addition, we're considering future events that mix in business into\nour efforts. If you're interested in that sort of thing then stay tuned\nfor more announcements.</p>\n<h2>What about sponsorship?</h2>\n<p>In return for sponsorship we mention your organization or person on the\nofficial event description, and provide many other perks including\nmention in social media.</p>\n<p>In fact, our attendees are well-noted for their feverish support of\nsponsors. Developer-only open source events are rare in Los Angeles, so\nattendees are incredibly grateful to those who make the event possible.</p>\n<p>If interested, keep in mind this event happened years ago.</p>\n<h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>\n<p>Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,\nthe venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to\nbring a power strip labeled with your name.</p>\n<h2>I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?</h2>\n<p>The event is $10, covers food and drink for the day, and you can RSVP\nby clicking on the image below</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/7132778527/\"><img src=\"/images/7132778527_6e3b49b313_o.png\" alt=\"Los Angeles Open Source Sprint\"></a></p>\n",

We need more talk and tutorial submissions. Talks are 30 or\n45 minute efforts in front of the PyCon audience and are recorded for\nposterity. Tutorials are three hours long and are given to attendees who\nhave paid an additional fee in order to slurp in knowledge from the\nmasters.</p>\n<p>On the 3 hour tutorial side of things, <strong>we especially need more Intro\nto Python level submission</strong>. That means getting beginners up to speed\non basic Python techniques, so they can then exploit the other\ntutorials, conference, and sprints to their full advantage.</p>\n<h1>Now onto some questions...</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>I would like to give a tutorial but it's so much work to put together 3 hours of quality content.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>The organizers of PyCon recognize that putting together a quality\ntutorial is an amazing amount of work. Which is why tutorial presenters\nare compensated for their effort.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What is the most likely length talk to be accepted? 30 minutes or 45 minutes?</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>The vast majority of PyCon sessions are 30 minutes long, so 45 minute\nslots are rare and valuable commodities. So if your talk needs to be 45\nminutes long your proposal has to really speak to the PyCon talk\nreviewers.</p>\n<p>Not only that, if reviewers send you information requests for any\nduration talk or tutorial, <strong>you dramatically increase your odds of talk\nacceptance with timely responses</strong>.</p>\n<p>And, as said before, PyCon really needs more <strong>introductory level Python\ntutorial</strong> submissions.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>I would like to present a talk or tutorial but I can't afford to come to PyCon.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>PyCon's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&#x26;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ\">financial aid\nprogram</a>\nis said to favor accepted speakers to PyCon. They really want you to\ncome!</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>I would like to present but I can't come up with a good idea!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>I had this problem as well! Then I looked at the <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/tutorials/suggested_topics_2012/\">Suggested Tutorial\nTopics</a> and\ngot some ideas.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Ack! I've got a talk idea but it's going to take me too much time to put it together!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Submit the talk anyway before the talk and in fields you aren't ready\nto fill in, simply put '<strong>TBD</strong>'. Then over the course of the next few\ndays replace TBD with real material. Don't wait too long though to fix\nthose TBDs, no more than a week!</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>I'm a beginner/nobody in the community, is there any chance my proposal will get accepted?</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong></p>\n<p>The PyCon talk/tutorial reviewers love to see new people present. While\nexperienced/proven speakers have an edge, good talk/tutorial proposals\nfrom promising candidates <strong>can</strong> make it into the conference. Carefully\ndouble-check your submission, be responsive to reviewers, and stay\npositive. I'm not saying you will get in, but I am saying it's worth\nthe effort.</p>\n<h1>Good luck!</h1>\n<p>PyCon 2013 is going to be bigger and better than any previous year.\nThat's because we pull together as a community to run an amazing event\nthat is known to jumpstart careers and cause amazing life changes.

It's now nearly the eve of <a href=\"https://djangodash.com\">Django Dash</a>,\nand I feel it's time to update the list. I'm going to bump the\nversions on some of the existing packages and add some new ones to the\nlist.</p>\n<h1>New Packages</h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-braces/\">django-braces==0.1.3</a></h2>\n<p>Want to use Django Class Based Views but unhappy with the missing\ncomponents like <code>LoginRequiredMixin</code>, <code>SelectRelatedMixin</code>, and even\n<code>StaffuserRequiredMixin</code>? Not to worry, as this library will make Django\nCBVs <strong>134% easier to use</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-secure/\">django-secure==0.1.2</a></h2>\n<p>Django is rather secure, but there is a checklist of things that the\nsecurity experts want you to do. Save yourself forgetting something and\nuse this library to do all those little things.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-profiletools/\">django-profiletools==0.1.3</a></h2>\n<p>Have you ever used the django-debug-toolbar and noticed that you did\nthat same <code>request.user.get_profile()</code> call a dozen times? Ever want to\njust call that once? This library, by yours truly, resolves the issue.\nIt loads the user's profile object once, and then passes it down the\nrequest chain.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Existing Packages</h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.4.1\">Django==1.4.1</a></h2>\n<p>If you need sessions, forms, templates, and relational database models,\nthen I can argue you've got the ideal\n<a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> project. Make certain you are running\nthe latest Django version (1.4.1). If you have any reason to stick to\nthe Django 1.3 series, I advise bumping it up to Django 1.3.2.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2\">psycopg2==2.4.5</a></h2>\n<p>This is the database connector to PostgreSQL, which is what you should\nbe using. Django is known for playing 'nicer' with PostgreSQL than\nsay... MySQL.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-debug-toolbar\">django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4</a></h2>\n<p>Because not using this tool is insane.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-extensions\">django-extensions==0.8</a></h2>\n<p>Because amongst other things this library gives you, I never want to\nwrite my own <code>TimeStampedModel</code> ever again. :-)</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/South\">South==0.7.6</a></h2>\n<p>Django gives you the freedom to migrate data in the way you want. The\nway I want to do it is via South.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-registration\">django-registration==0.8.0</a></h2>\n<p>The common go-to tool for non-Social registration.</p>\n<p>This is a very solid tool, but you do have to make your own templates or\nfind someone's fork that has a copy of templates that match.</p>\n<h2>django-social-auth== 0.7.4</h2>\n<p>Want to authenticate via Twitter, Facebook, or GitHub? Then use this\nvery useful package.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-floppyforms\">django-floppyforms==1.0</a></h2>\n<p>An excellent tool for making your forms HTML5-ish out of the box. It\nallows full control of form rendering in the templates.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crispy-forms\">django-crispy-forms==1.1.4</a></h2>\n<p>The child of my own django-uni-forms, this will let me create forms\nusing div-based controls super fast, and do layout customizations if I\nneed them.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-postgresify\">django-heroku-postgresify==0.2</a></h2>\n<p>This tool makes getting the PostGreSQL settings out of Heroku trivial.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-memcacheify\">django-heroku-memcacheify==0.3</a></h2>\n<p>This tool makes getting the memcache settings for Heroku trivial.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gunicorn\">gunicorn==0.14.6</a></h2>\n<p>All the cool kids who play in devops swear by Gunicorn.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Installing the above packages</h1>\n<p>Never copy/paste these libraries directly into your projects. Do it the\nright way: <strong>use proper Python dependency management</strong>.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install them as proper\ndependencies. The file should contain the following text:</p>\n<pre><code>Django==1.4.1\nSouth==0.7.5   \ndjango-braces==0.1.3    \ndjango-crispy-forms==1.1.4\ndjango-debug-toolbar==0.9.4\ndjango-extensions==0.8\ndjango-floppyforms==1.0\ndjango-social-auth==0.7.4\ndjango-heroku-memcacheify==0.3\ndjango-heroku-postgresify==0.2\ndjango-profiletools==0.1.3\ndjango-registration==0.8.0   \ndjango-secure==0.1.2\ngunicorn==0.14.2\npsycopg2==2.4.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have that, you install them thus in your\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\">virtualenv</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that I have all this, it's time to code!</p>\n",

The problem is that in complex libraries\nhaving to import both functions and exceptions becomes a drag. To\nmitigate having to remember to import custom exceptions, this is a handy\npattern you can use in a project and can be done on both functions and\nclasses.</p>\n<h1>Attaching a custom exception to a function</h1>\n<p>This works because <a href=\"https://python.org\">Python</a> functions are first-class\nobjects. They can be passed around as things, and in this case, have\nthings assigned to them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># logic.py\nclass DoesNotCompute(Exception):\n    \"\"\" Easy to understand naming conventions work best! \"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef this_function(x):\n    \"\"\" This function only works on numbers.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return x ** x\n    except TypeError:\n        raise DoesNotCompute\n\n# Assign DoesNotCompute exception to this_function\nthis_function.DoesNotCompute = DoesNotCompute\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I can import the function, and it won't just through\n<code>DoesNotCompute</code> exceptions, it will also carry the function along with\nthe import:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from logic import this_function\n>>> this_function(5)\n3125\n>>> this_function(4.5)\n869.8739233809259\n>>> this_function('will throw an error.')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&#x3C;input>\", line 1, in &#x3C;module>\n  File \"logic.py\", line 10, in this_function\n    raise DoesNotCompute\nDoesNotCompute\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alright, that doesn't seem like much, but let's add in some exception\nhandling:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> try:\n...     this_function('is an example')\n... except this_function.DoesNotCompute:\n...     print('See what attaching custom exceptions to functions can do?')\n...\n...\nSee what attaching custom exceptions to functions can do?\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Attaching the custom exception to a class</h1>\n<p>All we have to do is enhance our existing logic.py file by adding\n<code>ThisClass</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># logic.py\nclass DoesNotCompute(Exception):\n    \"\"\" Easy to understand naming conventions work best! \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n# removed the function example for clarity\n\nclass ThisClass(object):\n    # Since the DoesNotCompute exception exists, let's just assign it\n    # as an attribute of ThisClass\n    DoesNotCompute = DoesNotCompute\n\n    def this_method(self, x):\n        \"\"\" This method only works on numbers.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            return x ** x\n        except TypeError:\n            raise DoesNotCompute\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now to demonstrate in the shell (Python REPL for the semantic purists):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">>>> from t import ThisClass\n>>> this_class = ThisClass()\n>>> this_class.this_method(3.3)\n51.415729444066585\n>>> this_class.this_method('Jack Diederich warned against custom exceptions')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&#x3C;input>\", line 1, in &#x3C;module>\n  File \"logic.py\", line 24, in this_method\n    raise DoesNotCompute\nDoesNotCompute\n>>> try:\n...     this_class.this_method('I need to write a follow-up on my OAuth post')\n... except ThisClass.DoesNotCompute:\n...     print('Waiting to see how the OAuth stuff pans out')\n...\n...\nWaiting to see how the OAuth stuff pans out\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Admonition: Don't go crazy</h1>\n<p>Rather than use this trick all over the place, considering using it in a\nfew places to powerful effect. For example,\n<a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> uses it only in a few places, and\npublicly only on <code>MyModelClass.DoesNotExist</code> and\n<code>MyModelClass.MultipleObjectsReturned</code>. By limiting Django's use of\nthis technique, Django libraries are that much easier to comprehend. In\nthis case, less complexity means more.</p>\n<p>I say this because this pattern lends itself to creating custom\nexceptions to the point of effectively replacing Python's stock\nexceptions with your own. This makes for harder-to-maintain and\nharder-to-learn projects.</p>\n<p>Not that I've ever done that. Ahem.</p>\n",

For example, instead of\n<code>/profiles/pydanny/</code> I would go to <code>/my-crazy-profile/</code>. Also, I needed\nto force authentication.</p>\n<p>I've done this with Django functional views a few times times, but\ntoday I did it in Django. This is what I did:</p>\n<h2>1. Added django-braces to my project</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kennethlove\">Kenneth Love</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tehjones\">Chris\nJones</a>' awesome\n<a href=\"https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/\">django-braces</a> package has\nsome very handy mixins for working with Django CBVs. Kenneth and Chris\nreally understand CBVs, specifically on how to extend them, and have\nprovided a bunch of really useful utility methods in the django-braces\nlibrary. Yeah, I could figure this stuff out on my own, but since those\nguys already did the hard work I might as well just lean on them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install django-braces==0.1.3\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># settings.py\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n...\n'braces',\n...\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>2. Wrote the view</h2>\n<p>Assuming a very simple profile Model and Form (which they weren't - but\nthat's not what this post is about), this is how I implemented the\nview:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># profiles/views.py\nfrom django.views.generic import UpdateView\n\nfrom braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin  # handles authentication\n\nfrom profiles.forms import ProfileForm\nfrom profiles.models import Profile\n\nclass ProfileUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):\n\n    form_class = ProfileForm\n    success_url = \"/my-crazy-profile/\"  # You should be using reverse here\n\n    def get_object(self):\n        return Profile.objects.get(user=self.request.user)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>3. Wrote the URLconf</h2>\n<p>The URL pretty much wrote itself:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, url\n\nfrom profiles import views\n\nurlpatterns = patterns(\"\",\n    url(regex=r'^my-crazy-profile/$',\n        view=views.ProfileUpdateView.as_view(),\n        name='profile_update'),\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>For a while, I've used django-braces for anything that involves CBVs. I\ncan't imagine working on projects using CBVs without them. In fact,\nsome of the mixins such as <code>LoginRequiredMixin</code> are things that I could\nargue ought to be in core Django.</p>\n<p>This pattern really nails the sweet spot of Django CBVs. Thanks to the\nuse of mixins and model forms, I get an amazing amount of stuff done in\na 5 line CBV.</p>\n",

We went from 10 AM to 10 PM, and there was much coding and\nlearning done by all. There was a very powerful vibe shared by nearly\neveryone there, and it was great to see so many people from different\npersonal and open source backgrounds working together and having a great\ntime as a group.</p>\n<h1>Filtering out distractions</h1>\n<p>We made some changes to our proceedings for this event, entirely because\nlast time with 'distractions' that caused some issues. In a nutshell,\nhere is 50% of what we did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A clear statement in the event description and follow up emails that\nthis event was for developers and designers only.</li>\n<li>Laptops were an absolute requirement for entry into the event.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also rolled in a couple other tricks I'm not going to write down. If\nyou see me in person, ask away. The results were near perfect, and we\nwon't hesitate to use these techniques again.</p>\n<h1>Sponsors</h1>\n<p>We let attendees know which sponsors were interested in potential new\nhires, in this case, <a href=\"https://originatelabs.com\">Originate</a> and\n<a href=\"https://cars.com\">Cars.com</a>. This sort of low-key technique helps us\nland sponsors but doesn't annoy attendees. Speaking of sponsors, here\nthey are in alphabetical order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cars.com\">Cars.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cartwheelweb.com\">Cartwheel Web</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heroku.com\">Heroku</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://originatelabs.com\">Originate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Code/Projects worked on</h1>\n<p>Next time I'm going to be a lot more careful about getting down the\ndetails of what people did. Maybe a signup sheet or an online form?\nHeck, sounds like a great quick project for next time!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> (see below for details)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tglines.github.com/dynasaur/\">Dynasaur</a> (Node.js/DynamoDB\nORM)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/saltstack/salt\">Salt Stack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/philfree/meteordraw\">meteordraw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harph/pyit\">pyit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/symkat/DBIx-Config\">DBIx::Config</a></li>\n<li>Clojure Tutorials</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf\">engulf</a> (Clojure load testing\ntool that got 2 more tests)</li>\n<li>HTML5</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n<li>Lots more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Django Sprints</h1>\n<p>My conservative estimate is that we had 12 people working on Django or\nDjango related projects. That's at least 20% of attendees.\nUnfortunately, because I'm not a Django core developer, I wasn't\nreviewing commits; so I am not entirely sure what was being worked on. I\ndo know that I wasn't the only person to commit to core Django.</p>\n<p>As for me, I continued my efforts started at DjangoCon Europe to\nrefactor the\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/\">Class</a>\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/\">Based</a>\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/mixins/\">Views</a>\ndocumentation. I got in two pull requests and finally managed to badly\nteach myself how to use git rebase.</p>\n<p><strong>note</strong>: I want to make it exceedingly clear that I'm not the only one\nworking the CBV doc refactor. I'm just one of the fold.</p>\n<h1>Socializing</h1>\n<p>During meals we tried to keep people's hands off the keyboard.\nSpecifically everyone got a chance to state their name, toolset they\nwere working with, and something interesting/embarrassing about\nthemselves. Three of the more memorable ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An 8 year old attendee wrote his first 4 PHP programs!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sym_kat\">sym_kat</a> is invited to speak at the\nnext London Perl Workshop.</li>\n<li>Someone employed at SpaceX took Zed Shaw's\n<a href=\"https://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">LPTHW</a> class taught by the man\nhimself at <a href=\"https://cartwheelweb.com\">Cartwheel Web</a> HQ in 2011 got\nhimself moved from the C# to the Python team. Go open source!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>\n<p>There were a few glitches, but nothing major. Most of those glitches\nstem from us coming off two months of helping organize multiple events\nwhile traveling literally around the world. I think things would have\nbeen better if I had delegated more to the right people.</p>\n<p>For the most part, there was this electrifying energy that had people\nfocused and working on what they wanted all day. Yet it wasn't all\nheads-down-coding, their was some good coder-to-coder discussion and\nfun. The result is at the end of the day people seemed refreshed and\nempowered, wanting another day as soon as possible. We hope to be able\nto catch this feeling at future events.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Corrected the details about the SpaceX guy.</p>\n",

In a few days the site will launch, and even if\nsomeone got through the authentication, nothing bad will happen except\nfor an early visitor. So we determined this was a job for a very simple\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\">Basic access\nauthentication</a>\nimplementation.</p>\n<p>I asked around and <a href=\"https://jacobian.org/\">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> gave me\nthis awesome snippet using <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/barrel\">barrel</a>\nthat I pasted right into the bottom of the\n<a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> 1.4-style application's <code>wsgi.py</code>\nfile.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Add to the bottom of your wsgi.py file\n# Don't forget to add barrel to your requirements!\nfrom barrel import cooper\n\nREALM = \"PRIVATE\"\nUSERS = [('spam', 'eggs')]\n\napplication = cooper.basicauth(users=USERS, realm=REALM)(get_wsgi_application())\n</code></pre>\n<p>This took all of 5 minutes to implement and launch.

Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.</p>\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malcolmt\">Malcolm Tredinnick</a> on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219425413301157889\">twitter</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Primary funding for the sprints came from the <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation\">Django Software\nFoundation</a> and <a href=\"https://pythonsprints.com/\">Python\nSprints</a>. That funding went towards food,\ndrinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee\nturnout. Things sprinted on:</p>\n<h2>Django</h2>\n<p>Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could\nfit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort,\nwith <a href=\"https://marconijr.com/\">Marconi</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marconimjr\">Moreto</a> helping out. It turned into\nmostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was\nvery heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their\nown, and then work on projects using the framework.</p>\n<p>I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django\ncore.</p>\n<p>I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but\nit was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get\nmoving in Django and other projects.</p>\n<h2>Ansible</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://capsunlock.net\">Rodney</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/cocoy\">Quillo</a> led\nthe sprint on the <a href=\"https://ansible.github.com/\">Ansible</a> tool of which he\nis so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They\nseemed very productive and happy by day's end.</p>\n<h2>pymongo</h2>\n<p>A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out\nan edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts,\nbut I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is\nvery common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of\ngeography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more\nprevalent in the island nation.</p>\n<h2>Other efforts</h2>\n<p>Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going\non and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there\nhelping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the\nmoment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording\nthe efforts of so many.</p>\n<h2>Tutorial Room</h2>\n<p>About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is\nwhere speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the\nconference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the\nroom was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez</li>\n<li>Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/intro-to-python-11186202\">21 Cool Things You Can Do With\nPython</a>\nby Daniel Greenfeld (me)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Food and drinks</h1>\n<p>I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon\nPhilippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided\nrather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good\nprofessional catering service that most conferences rely on to the\ndismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.</p>\n<p>For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to\nPino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.</p>\n<h1>Conference End</h1>\n<p>The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words\nabout how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was\nto see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired\nhe felt.</p>\n<p>Then we cheered him.</p>\n<p>After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends.\nWhich meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end.\nI felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was\ncoming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that\nI had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.</p>\n<p>More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/7516869028/\"><img src=\"/images/7516869028_ff24aaa027_z.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></a></p>\n",

I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you\nwhy.</p>\n<h1>Arrival</h1>\n<p>Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us\nto the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all\nthe while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his\nlovely 21 month old daughter.</p>\n<p>As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend,\nFilipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing\nkeynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in\nthe Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at\nPyCon PH.</p>\n<p>Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were\ngreeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She\nhad over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of\nregistrants.</p>\n<p>More on the herculean efforts of the organizers and volunteers of this\nevent in a forthcoming blog post.</p>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say\nhello. There we met <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrvaldez\">Sony Valdez</a>,\nPresident of <a href=\"https://www.13hq.com/\">Agoo Computer College</a>, and forty of\nhis faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and excitement,\nbelying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before in\norder to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey,\nBryan, and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and\nwere determined in our speeches not to disappoint.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in\nthe middle of the afternoon. <strong>We didn't know they had to go until it\nwas time to leave</strong>. Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help\nthem come for the duration of the conference.</p>\n<h1>PyCon Begins</h1>\n<p>After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy\nValdez, started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH\nchair thanked everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and\nespecially the attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about\nshortly, and then it was time for the talks.</p>\n<h2>Intro to Python<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/basic_python.html\">^1</a></h2>\n<p>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/titopao\">Paolo Barazon</a></p>\n<p>Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment\nissues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I\nspoke at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they\ncouldn't get the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job\nunder very trying conditions.</p>\n<h2>Python Tricks you can't live without<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/python_tricks.html\">^2</a></h2>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy</a></p>\n<p>Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know\nin Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and\nvirtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered\nhome the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this\nwas the best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)</p>\n<h2>Django Quickstart<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/django_quickstart.html\">^3</a></h2>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://marconijr.com/\">Marconi</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marconimjr\">Moreto</a></p>\n<p>Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good\nintroduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the\nnext day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a\nsimple TODO app, and you can see the working example at\n<a href=\"https://quickstart.marconijr.com/\">https://quickstart.marconijr.com/</a>.</p>\n<h2>Game Programming with Python<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/game_programming.html\">^4</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you afraid of math? Too bad! In this tutorial you will learn how\nto math! Scary, isn't it?</p>\n<p>-- Sony Valdez</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math\nwhile wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the\nbest one I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and\nextremely funny. And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep\n(remember - he was on a bus with 40 of his students and faculty), he\nbroke many classic presenter rules:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Live code demo</strong></p>\n<p>He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes\npart of the talk.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Used notepad</strong></p>\n<p>That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He\nused notepad.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Someone else's laptop</strong></p>\n<p>He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a\nkeyboard you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with\nwhile after a 5+ hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night\nbefore.</p>\n<p>I'm in awe.</p>\n<h2>Functional Programming in Python<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/functional_programming.html\">^5</a></h2>\n<p>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malcolmt\">Malcolm Tredinnick</a></p>\n<p>Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of\nhis classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this\ntalk before, but this instance was clearly the best.</p>\n<h2>Ansible<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/ansible.html\">^6</a></h2>\n<p>by <a href=\"https://capsunlock.net\">Rodney</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/cocoy\">Quillo</a></p>\n<p>What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering?\nFortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on\n<a href=\"https://ansible.github.com/\">Ansible</a>, a pretty new Python based\ndeployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range of options,\nand simplicity of use.</p>\n<h2>I didn't know it's Python: Python Advocacy<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/python_advocacy.html\">^7</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"PyCon: More fun in the Philippines\"</p>\n<p>-- Variant of the <a href=\"https://www.itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/\">Philippines Department of Tourism\nslogan</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to\npromote it's use, and why it's so awesome for... well.. lots of\nthings.</p>\n<h2>Maps of Imaginary Lands<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/closing-keynote.html\">^8</a></h2>\n<p>Malcom came back to give us a talk on how to assemble the components\nnecessary to do a mashup of an imaginary place he cooked up.</p>\n<h2>Closing Keynote: Design your open source project<a href=\"https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconPH2012/closing-keynote.html\">^9</a></h2>\n<p>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanveloso\">Bryan</a>\n<a href=\"https://avalonstar.com/\">Veloso</a></p>\n<p>Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech\ninstructing beginners on how to make your project used and loved by\ndevelopers. His slides were incredible, <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/u/bryan/p/design-your-own-open-source-project\">as you should see for\nyourself</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/pycon-philippines-day-1.html\">Read Day 2 of PyCon Philippines!</a></p>\n",

Here are 10\nreasons why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Chocolate</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For\nexample, Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of\n<a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Cheese</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much\nmore. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master\ncraftsmen from the freshest ingredients.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a word, Jessica is <strong>incredible</strong>. She's a Twisted core developer,\nPSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic Boston\nPython User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker.\nShe's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in\nthe community and generally help other people.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Breakfast</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how\nmuch better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's\nhomeland.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Web Site</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those\nanimations!</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Talks</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and\nAndrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice\nthings up. And dare I say I'm giving a technical talk\nwith Audrey Roy? ;-)</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Mountains</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen\nkilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Sprints</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be\nDjango core developers around! There will also be notable\n<a href=\"https://python.org\">Python</a> developers like <a href=\"https://kennethreitz.com/\">Kenneth\nReitz</a> and others around working hard on a lot\nof different projects. It's going to intense and fun!</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\n<h1><strong>Castles</strong></h1>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon\nEurope will be near a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_Switzerland#Zurich\">small horde of stone\nfortifications</a>.\nWhich means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference,\nwe'll have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist\ndestinations. :-)</p>\n<h1>What are you waiting for?</h1>\n<p>DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have\nbeen selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!</p>\n<h1>It's all about me</h1>\n<p>Yup.</p>\n<p>Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all\nour European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in\nZurich!</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>First off, out of the box, <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> lets you\nconstruct API responses with a little work. All you need to do is\nsomething like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Copied from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/class-based-views/#more-than-just-html\nfrom django import http\nfrom django.utils import simplejson as json\n\nclass JSONResponseMixin(object):\n    def render_to_response(self, context):\n        \"Returns a JSON response containing 'context' as payload\"\n        return self.get_json_response(self.convert_context_to_json(context))\n\n    def get_json_response(self, content, **httpresponse_kwargs):\n        \"Construct an `HttpResponse` object.\"\n        return http.HttpResponse(content,\n                                 content_type='application/json',\n                                 **httpresponse_kwargs)\n\n    def convert_context_to_json(self, context):\n        \"Convert the context dictionary into a JSON object\"\n        # Note: This is *EXTREMELY* naive; in reality, you'll need\n        # to do much more complex handling to ensure that arbitrary\n        # objects -- such as Django model instances or querysets\n        # -- can be serialized as JSON.\n        return json.dumps(context)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you get that mixin, use it in your views like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># modified from djangoproject.com sample code\nfrom django.utils import simplejson as json\n\nclass JSONDetailView(JSONResponseMixin, MyCustomUserView):\n    def convert_context_to_json(self, context):\n\n        context['objects'] = User.objects.values('first_name','last_name','is_active')\n        return json.dumps(context)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works pretty well in a number of simple cases, but doing things\nlike pagination, posting of data, metadata, API discovery, and other\nimportant things ends up being a bit more work. This is where the\nresource oriented API frameworks come in.</p>\n<h1>What makes a decent API Framework?</h1>\n<p>These features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pagination</li>\n<li>posting of data with validation</li>\n<li>Publishing of metadata along with querysets</li>\n<li>API discovery</li>\n<li>proper HTTP response handling</li>\n<li>caching</li>\n<li>serialization</li>\n<li>throttling</li>\n<li>permissions</li>\n<li>authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proper API frameworks also need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really good test coverage of their code</li>\n<li>Decent performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>An active community to advance and support the framework</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you take these factors, at this time there are only two API\nframeworks worth using, <a href=\"#django-tastypie\">django-tastypie</a> and\n<a href=\"#django-rest-framework\">django-rest-framework</a>.</p>\n<h1>Which one is better? django-tastypie or django-rest-framework?</h1>\n<p>I say they are equal.</p>\n<p>You simply can't go wrong with either one. The authors and communities\nbehind both of them are active, the code is solid and tested. And here\nare my specific thoughts about both of them:</p>\n<h1>django-tastypie</h1>\n<p>Using django-tastypie is like playing with pure Python while using the\nDjango ORM. I find it very comfortable. Seems really fast too. The\ndocumentation is incredible, and I rarely have any problems figuring\nanything out. It also supports OAuth 1.0a out of the box, which is\nmighty awesome these days.</p>\n<p>In fact, I wrote a custom OAuth2 handler for django-tastypie for\nconsumer.io that I'm working to extract for\npublication.</p>\n<h1>django-rest-framework</h1>\n<p>As it's based off Django 1.3 style Class Based Views (CBVs), it has a\nvery familiar pattern. Actually, because of the quality of the\ndocumentation, I really prefer using django-rest-framework CBVs more\nthan using Django's actual CBVs.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should make an HTML renderer for django-rest-framework? :-)</p>\n<h1>But what about django-piston?</h1>\n<p><strong>Don't use django-piston</strong>.</p>\n<p>I don't want to say anything negative, but let's face it:\n<strong>django-piston is dead</strong>. Besides a critical security release last\nyear, nothing has been done for it in about 3 years. The documentation\nis weak, the code mostly untested, and the original author left. He has\ngone on to do some amazing things. Django-piston was amazing in its\ntime, but its time has passed and so should you.</p>\n<p>The only reason for using django-piston for years has been that it\nsupported OAuth, but django-tastypie now addresses that use case.

What are my package dependencies?</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.4\">Django==1.4</a></h1>\n<p>Unlike my last quick project which was <a href=\"https://flask.pocoo.org/\">Flask</a>,\nthis effort really falls into <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a>'s\nsweet spot. I need sessions, forms, templates, and models to do things\nin an ideal Django pattern.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2\">psycopg2==2.4.5</a></h1>\n<p>I need transactions and hard-type validation in the database, which\nmeans PostgreSQL. If I didn't need transactions or the hard-type\nvalidation I would consider MongoDB instead.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-debug-toolbar\">django-debug-toolbar==0.9.4</a></h1>\n<p>Because not using this tool is insane.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-extensions\">django-extensions==0.8</a></h1>\n<p>Because amongst other things this library gives you, I never want to\nwrite my own <code>TimeStampedModel</code> ever again. :-)</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/South\">South==0.7.5</a></h1>\n<p>Django gives you the freedom to migrate data in the way you want. The\nway I want to do it is via South.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-registration\">django-registration==0.8.0</a></h1>\n<p>Normally\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-social-auth\">django-social-auth</a> is\nmy go-to tool for registration, but in this case I need simple\nusername/password registration. This is a very solid tool, but you do\nhave to make your own templates or find someone's fork that has a copy\nof templates that match.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2013/12/17</strong>: django-registration is no longer maintained and\ndoesn't entirely work with modern Django's new user model system. Use\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth\">django-allauth</a> instead.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-floppyforms\">django-floppyforms==0.4.7</a></h1>\n<p>An excellent tool for making your forms HTML5-ish out of the box.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crispy-forms\">django-crispy-forms==1.1.3</a></h1>\n<p>The child of my own django-uni-forms, this will let me create forms\nusing div-based controls super fast, and do layout customizations if I\nneed them.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-postgresify\">django-heroku-postgresify==0.2</a></h1>\n<p>This tool makes getting the PostGreSQL settings out of Heroku trivial.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-heroku-memcacheify\">django-heroku-memcacheify==0.1</a></h1>\n<p>This tool makes getting the memcache settings for Heroku trivial.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gunicorn\">gunicorn==0.14.2</a></h1>\n<p>All the cool kids who play in devops swear by Gunicorn. I use it because\nHeroku seems to recommend it for Django deployments.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Installing the above packages</h1>\n<p>Never copy/paste these libraries directly into your projects. If you do\nthat, you'll end up hating yourself later as your local instances\nbecome unmaintained forks of the real project. Also, unless you are\nreally careful in your copy/pasting, you'll be in violation of various\nopen source licenses. Odds are the FOSS police aren't going to find\nyou, but I can assure you that when you bring in one of the authors of\nthese packages to help you fix a problem he/she is going to be mighty\nannoyed at the lack of attribution.</p>\n<p>Do it the right way: do proper Python dependency management.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install them as proper\ndependencies. The file should contain the following text:</p>\n<pre><code>Django==1.4\nSouth==0.7.5\ndjango-crispy-forms==1.1.3\ndjango-debug-toolbar==0.9.4\ndjango-extensions==0.8\ndjango-floppyforms==0.4.7\ndjango-heroku-memcacheify==0.1\ndjango-heroku-postgresify==0.2\ndjango-registration==0.8.0\ngunicorn==0.14.2\npsycopg2==2.4.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have that, you install them thus in your\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\">virtualenv</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that I have all this, it's time to code!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/4358842735/\"><img src=\"/images/4358842735_38991c0944.jpg\" alt=\"2010 Snowstorm!\"></a></p>\n",

They'll be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or\nnice people like me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and\nmore!</p>\n<p>RSVP at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/\">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/</a> before it\nfills up! It's free.</p>\n<p>I'll be there to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles\ntechnical community!</li>\n<li>Code like a fiend. I want to work on django-mongonaut and could use\nsome GraphViz and JavaScript help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>\n<h1>Where and when?</h1>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<pre><code>Spire.io\n7257 Beverly Blvd #210\nLos Angeles, CA 90036\n</code></pre>\n<p>When:</p>\n<pre><code>May 12, 2012\n10 AM to 10 PM\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Is this like a Hackathon?</h1>\n<p>Yup. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints</a></p>\n<h1>Will there be Wifi?</h1>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<h1>I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?</h1>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p><strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place. Instead,\nyou might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In\nfact, here's a good <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/\">bi-weekly hack night / study\ngroup</a> for you.</p>\n<p><strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great way to\nlearn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced\ndevelopers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are\ncalled 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for\nbeginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at\nevents like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other\nthings that have made me a better coder.</p>\n<h1>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</h1>\n<p>Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join\nand contribute to in order to make the world a better place. There\nisn't a list up yet, but I'm hoping by Saturday there will be one.</p>\n<h1>What if I want to come and recruit people?</h1>\n<p><strong>Absolutely not</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is not a job fair and we don't want unnecessary distractions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we'll happily mention\nyou on the\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/\">meetup.com</a>\ndescription.</p>\n<h1>Are there going to be any presentations or lightning talks?</h1>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>This is a sprint, not a conference or demonstration. We'll try and\nlimit announcements and interruptions as much as possible, the only\nexception being for letting you know food has arrived.</p>\n<h1>What should I bring?</h1>\n<p>Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,\nthe venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to\nbring a power strip labeled with your name.</p>\n<h1>I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?</h1>\n<p>The event costs you nothing and you RSVP at\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/\">https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/</a>.</p>\n",

Today, with this blog post, I've managed to do just that - get on the\nLongest Streaks.</p>\n<p>Calendar About Nothing tracks your open project commits on\n<a href=\"https://github.com\">Github</a>. It tallies your total number of days,\nrecords your longest streak, and lets you compare yourself against other\ncommitters. The idea comes from an\n<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret?tag=softwaremotivation\">article</a>\nwhere Jerry Seinfeld says his secret to productivity is to get something\ndone every day, because if you skip one day then skipping another day is\neasier.</p>\n<h1>I feel a great sense of accomplishment.</h1>\n<p>The majority of those days I would like to think I did real commits. I\npledged to myself to do more than just white space tweaks or write a\nscript to do the work for me. I wanted to accomplish things and make a\ndifference. I started projects, wrote code, cleaned up old code, added\ntests, documented a lot, and moved my blog here. It's been an awesome\ntime, and keeping my fingers constantly in projects has been eye\nopening.</p>\n<h1>I feel a great sense of relief.</h1>\n<p>I've really enjoyed this but there were days it was hard to get to the\ninternet or days I was busy on other things. I discovered early on my\nphone was not a good interface with Github's text editor. Some days I\nhad no desire to code or lacked the creativity to write. Then I\nremembered that my ability to work openly on Github is a gift, and I\nshould just do it. Now I can relax a bit and if I miss a day, it's not\nsuch a big deal. I've made it to the Longest Streak list!</p>\n<h1>Going for a longer streak</h1>\n<p>We'll see what happens now. I just feel happy that I've captured the\nmoment and made my mark on the board.

Then I called the other people on set and we\ncaught it. I really didn't think much of it afterwards until after\nthe shoot.

The problem, however, is that the existing projects\nare not usable as-is, and need the support of the community in order to\nimprove.</p>\n<p>The terrible thing is that this is a solved problem within our\ncommunity. Python based projects are successfully implementing OAuth\nproviders, and often using internally hacked versions of the efforts\nI'm about to describe.

As an API provider, being an OAuth\nprovider might be more challenging, but it's the responsible thing to\ndo.</p>\n<h1>Existing OAuth Providers</h1>\n<p>Time to get into the meat of the issue. Let's look at the current\nimplementations of OAuth providing within the Python community.

            "content_html": "<p>In mid-November me and my fiancee, <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey Roy</a>\nbegan our startup. We had been frustrated with trying to do on-line\nproduct research and came up with an idea to take the lessons learned\nfrom <a href=\"https://djangopackages.com\">Django Packages</a> / <a href=\"https://opencomparison.org\">Open\nComparison</a> and apply them to a commercial\neffort. The result has been <a href=\"https://consumernotebook.com\">Consumer\nNotebook</a>, and it's been a steadily\ngrowing success.</p>\n<p>We've been bootstrapping the project. That means supporting it with\nconsulting and grinding away on it during our free time. That means\n12-16 hour days of Python, Django, and Javascript coding, marketing,\nsystem administration, graphic design, communicating with users and\nvendors, and a thousand other tasks. Since we've had to explore new\ntechniques for making things work on the backend and front end, that\nmeans we've needed to have a robust system that is trivial to deploy\nand certain to never go down. Which, of course, requires serious sys\nadmin skills.</p>\n<h1>The Big Problem</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>I hate system administration work.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sys admin is boring. I find it tedious and dull. Devops doesn't make it\neasier/faster, it just makes it possible to do it at a large scale.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me, my fiancee likes the sys admin side of things.\nHowever, she's got serious programming skills in Python/Javascript,\nunderstands CSS, is an excellent illustrator, and has good business\nskills to boot. Which means <strong>I needed Audrey not to be doing sys\nadmin</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Solution: Platform as a Service</h1>\n<p>Platform as a Service, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaaS\">PaaS</a>, is\nwhere someone else does the majority of work involved in system\nadministration. There are now <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Heroku-equivalent-for-Django-applications-Edit-Question-not-relevant-anymore-as-Heroku-now-supports-Django\">dozens of companies edging into the\nPython capable PaaS\nspace</a>.\nWe've been leery of using any of them but finally settled on\n<a href=\"https://heroku.com\">Heroku</a> after a long period of evaluation.</p>\n<h1>Why Heroku?</h1>\n<p>We choose Heroku for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We competed in a Los Angeles area Hacking contest with <a href=\"https://rdegges.com/\">Randall\nDegges</a>. He was responsible for the sys admin\nand went with Heroku. He got it up and it was out of the way for the\ncompetition. He spent his time coding, adding features, and fixing\ntemplates instead of tweaking knobs on something in the cloud. We\nsaw other people not deliver products at the contest because of this\nissue.</li>\n<li>Heroku doesn't lock you in. If I wanted to, I could take all the\npieces out in about 10 minutes, then go old school and host it\nmyself on my own closet server.</li>\n<li>Heroku has very good\n<a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres\">PostgreSQL</a>\nsupport. Our web framework is <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\">Django</a>,\nwhich has an ORM that works best with PostgreSQL.</li>\n<li>Heroku has staff. At least seventy of them. Odds are they would have\npeople around 24/7 to deal with issues.</li>\n<li>The add-on system means they've got many other people adding great\nnew features. Want <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/mongolab\">MongoDB</a>? No\nproblem! How about something to <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/pandastream\">handle\nvideo</a>? You got it!</li>\n<li>Heroku scales up trivially. If we get an upswell of users, I just\ntype <code>heroku ps:scale web=50</code> and I've got 50 web server things\nhandling the load.</li>\n<li>When I think of Heroku I think of Puffer Fish. Which is awesome\nbecause Puffer Fish are awesome.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/saspotato/5776592544/\"><img src=\"/images/5776592544_fb15a2902a_m.jpg\" alt=\"Puffer fish\"></a></p>\n<p>Creative Commons: Some rights reserved by\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/saspotato/5776592544/\">Saspotato</a></p>\n<h2>Things that we really liked about using Heroku</h2>\n<p>As we progressed down the journey of building our site, we discovered\neven more nice features about Heroku. Here are some of the things that\nreally make me smile:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases\">Releases</a> and\nespecially\n<a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases#rollback\">rollbacks</a>\nmeans we deploy with a lot more confidence.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging\">Logging</a> and other\ndiagnostic add-ons like <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/sentry\">Sentry</a>\nand <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic\">New Relic</a> means we know\nwhat's going on.</li>\n<li>During one huge data migration effort I scaled up the workers so a 6\nhour task became a 5 minute task. Cost was less then 10 cents for\nworkers instead of me losing hours of labor.</li>\n<li>In case we go viral, we don't have to worry about load balancers\nand all that high performance stuff.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What does that mean?</h1>\n<p>It means I'm doing the deployments. I'm the sys admin. And I'm happy\nwith my role because it takes minutes out of my day. Me and Audrey team\nup on everything else and the results so far have been great. If you've\never worked with me, the fact that <a href=\"https://consumernotebook.com\">Consumer\nNotebook</a> is administered and deployed by\nme is going to be a shock.</p>\n<p>We've been able to really focus on development of the project. And when\nI mean development, I mean a lot of things. I mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Django</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>CSS</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n<li>Data Modeling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.consumernotebook.com/\">Documenting the API</a></li>\n<li>Marketing: <a href=\"https://insidertips.consumernotebook.com/\">blogging on Consumer\nNotebook</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/consumernotebk\">Tweeting</a>, and working with\nother groups</li>\n<li>Trying out <a href=\"https://github.com/consumernotebook/tickets/issues\">public\ntickets</a></li>\n<li>Iterating through the user experience by communicating to users</li>\n<li>All the boring legal and business stuff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What you don't see is anything about sys admin issues. That's because\nwhat could have been a huge sink in time and resources is pretty much\ngone. We deploy staging servers with a bit of code I copy/pasted from a\nbash history into a Fabric script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from fabric.api import local\n\ncommands = \"\"\"\nheroku create --stack cedar\nheroku addons:add memcache\nheroku config:add S3_KEY=HAHAHAHAHAHA S3_SECRET=NOTGIVINGITOUT\nheroku addons:add redistogo\nheroku addons:add sendgrid:starter\nheroku addons:add mongolab:starter\nheroku addons:add sentry:test\nheroku addons:add pgbackups\nheroku addons:add custom_domains:basic\nheroku addons:add zerigo_dns:basic\nheroku domains:add staging.consumernotebook.com\nheroku addons:add ssl:piggyback\ngit push heroku master\nheroku scale web=1\nheroku addons:add heroku-PostgreSQL:ronin\nheroku pg:wait\n\"\"\"\n\ndef build_staging():\n    for command in commands.strip().split('\\n'):\n        local(command)\n</code></pre>\n<p>How awesome is that?</p>\n<h1>How much does Heroku really cost?</h1>\n<p>You can do Heroku for free. A lot of people do. More power to them.</p>\n<p>But let's face it, beyond a certain point, every PaaS, including\nHeroku, is going to be more expensive then getting your own EC2,\nRackspace, Dreamhost, or Linode hosted server. For a fraction of the\ncost, you can provision a server, install all the bits, configure the\ndatabase, http server, load balancers, and even write Chef/Puppet/Fabric\nscripts so you can do it repeatedly at scale. Cheap!</p>\n<p>So why pay more for Heroku? Why not just do it ourselves? For example,\nright now we're on dedicated PostgreSQL hosting which Heroku charges us\n$200/month. That's a lot, right?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right now we're seeing a 50% increase in visits every day. So if we ran\nour own servers, Chef/Puppet/Fabric or not, odds are we would be\nspending at least 10 hours a month doing server work. And I can assure\nyou that when we consult that we make more than $20/hour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>$200 &#x3C; 10 hours of us doing consulting work to bootstrap the\nproject.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Until you hit a certain point, these days the real cost of servers is\nlabor. If you're a developer or small effort, and you think going with\na cheap hosting provider is the way to go, think again. Think about the\nhours you're losing monkeying around with servers and databases instead\nof getting code done.</p>\n<p>Heroku saves us money.</p>\n<h1>The Takeaway</h1>\n<p>One of the problems Django and other Python web frameworks has had is\nthe difficulty of deployment. I can't tell you how many projects I\ndidn't do because of the thought of handling the sys admin side of\nthings. Let's face it, one of the great ongoing successes for PHP is\nthat deploying the majority of sites is trivial.</p>\n<p>With the rise of devops we've seen a lot of developers across languages\nand frameworks dive into <strong>Chef</strong> and <strong>Puppet</strong>. It's been sadly\namusing watching people muck around with these great tools to make the\ndeployment of 1-2 servers 'easier', when the real benefit of those\ntools has been to do things at scale. Things like deployments of fifty\nservers at once or deployment abstractions for hundreds of people (my\nfancy talk for PaaS).</p>\n<p>In any case, things have changed. Deploying Python web apps is as\ntrivial as deploying PHP code.</p>\n<p>For developers I see great times ahead.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3643910\">Discuss this post on Hacker\nNews</a></p>\n",

That was for version\n0.1, with some core code that was literally a merger between the Django\nform example on how to integrate divs into forms and the simplest\ntemplate tag I could figure out.</p>\n<p>The python code in <code>uni_form/templatetags/uni_form.py</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.template import Context, Template\nfrom django.template.loader import get_template\nfrom django import template\n\n\nregister = template.Library()\n\n@register.filter\ndef as_uni_form(form):\n    template = get_template('templates/uni_form.html')\n    c = Context({'form':form})\n\n    return template.render(c)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The template tag code was nearly exactly copy/pasted from the starter\n<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/forms/#looping-over-the-form-s-fields\">Django docs on\nforms</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-django\">{% for field in form %}\n    &#x3C;div class=\"ctrlHolder {% if field.errors %}error{% endif %}\">\n        {% for error in field.errors %}\n            &#x3C;p class=\"errorField\">\n                &#x3C;strong>{{ error }}&#x3C;/strong>\n            &#x3C;/p>       \n        {% endfor %}\n        {{ field.label_tag }}\n        {{ field }}\n        {% if field.help_text %}\n        &#x3C;p class=\"formHint\">\n            {{ field.help_text }}\n        &#x3C;/p>\n        {% endif %}\n\n    &#x3C;/div>\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using it was trivial, you just wrote out:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-django\">{% load uni_form %}\n\n&#x3C;form>\n    {{ form|as_uni_form }}\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Days of django-uni-form</h1>\n<p>Leading up to PyCon 2009 James Tauber suggested some things that lead to\nthe\n<a href=\"https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html#form-helpers\">FormHelpers</a>,\nand we hammered out the API on IRC. We knew it crossed the rigid lines\nbetween Model-View-Template, but sometimes it's advantageous to break a\nfew rules and abstractions in order to get better things down the road</p>\n<p>At PyCon 2009 with the mentoring of Jannis, James, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brosner\">Brian\nRosner</a>, I moved the project from google\ncode to <a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form\">Github</a>. Jannis\nreleased it on <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/\">PyPI</a> and I followed the\npattern he showed me for two years. Yeah, I learned tons under those\nguys.</p>\n<p>After PyCon 2009 a pull request with the\n<a href=\"https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/helpers.html#layouts\">Layout</a>\nhelper was provided. It took some work to make it pass all the tests and\nuse cases, but the end result was definition of form layout in the\nPython. This broke the rigid battle lines of Model-View-Template and\nleft purists screaming in agony, but it certainly made working with\nforms in Django trivially easy.</p>\n<p>Lots of people started to use the project across projects like Pinax and\norganizations like NASA, <a href=\"https://pbs.org\">PBS</a>, Discovery Channel,\nvarious newspapers and many others. Lots of pull requests came in and\nthe features grew.</p>\n<p>In 2010, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arowla\">Alice Rowland</a> submitted the first\n<a href=\"https://sphinx.pocoo.org/\">Sphinx</a> docs, and it was her work that really\nhelped get me started on doing lots of Sphinx work.</p>\n<p>And, all the way into 2011, pull requests for Django Form Sets started\nto come rolling in, and almost none were of acceptable quality. They\nnever came with documentation, tests, and almost always broke existing\ntests really hard. Since I'm not a huge fan of Django FormSets, I\ndidn't want to put in a ton of effort making them work. I believe one\nof them was pretty good, but life was crazy busy at the time and I let\nit slide. Apologies to whoever it was gave me a working FormSet pull\nrequest with documentation, tests, and working code.</p>\n<p>Long periods were going by without new versions. I admit I often slow\nabout accepting pull requests. Life was busy and reviewing the incoming\ncode took a lot of time. Browser cross-checking, running tests, and more\nwas really time consuming. I tried to get others to become co-leads on\nthe project, but invariably they didn't have time to do it. Note: If\nsomeone asks you to co-lead something, respond in 24 hours.</p>\n<h1>Enter Miguel Araujo</h1>\n<p>After PyCon 2011, when there was some unpleasant stress in my life, I\nwoke up cranky one morning and mouthed off on twitter to this guy who\nasked me to accept a pull request on django-uni-form. This guy tweeted\nback to me saying I ought to be nicer since I had a library people\nliked.</p>\n<p>He was right.</p>\n<p>I apologized to the guy (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/maraujop\">Miguel Araujo</a>)\nand remembered my manners. Over the next couple of months we chatted via\nTwitter and Github's messaging system. He was smart, trustworthy, and\npassionate about everything he did. I knew I had found my co-lead. He\nresponded promptly and I gave him commit rights.</p>\n<p>Working together (with him doing the vast majority of the work), we\nmoved the project into new releases. The architecture and design\nchanged, driven by discussions we had together. The code was cleaned up,\ngnarly bits in there to support old versions of Python and Django kicked\nout, and the documentation revised. The project had new life!</p>\n<p>The only blip I saw with Miguel is my own fault of sometimes being too\nnice as a project leader when it comes to accepting pull requests. <a href=\"https://django-uni-form.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#how-to-get-your-pull-request-accepted\">I\nbelieve pull requests should be really\natomic</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>for one thing and one thing only with support tests and documentation.\nOtherwise it becomes nigh impossible to incorporate them and these days\nI reject multi-purpose pull requests. One pull request in particular\ntook a huge amount of debate and discussion to work in. I think after\nthat Miguel is much better at being upfront at the beginning about\nrejecting pull requests with giant scopes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During all this I asked Miguel to take over the project, he accepted,\nand <a href=\"https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/06/announcing-django-uni-form-080-beta.html\">I even blogged my announcement his role as project\nleader</a>.\nMiguel is indeed very nice and after that fact he asked me to remain on\nboard as co-lead.</p>\n<p>We finally met in September of 2011 and co-presented on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/advanced-django-forms-usage\">Advanced Django\nForm Usage at DjangoCon\n2011</a>.\nThe deepest technical material we presented was authored by Miguel.\nDuring our research he uncovered at least one bug in Django and got an\nancient bug closed. It was a great experience and I hope he'll\nco-present with me in the future.</p>\n<h1>django-uni-form is dead, long live django-crispy-forms</h1>\n<p>The upside of django-uni-form is that it grew in features organically\nthanks to my own needs and general community effort. The downside of\ndjango-uni-form is that it grew in features organically thanks to my own\nneeds and general community effort. In any long running project there is\ncruft and weird patterns that start to hurt after a while.\ndjango-uni-form was no different.</p>\n<p>So I'm making this absolutely official as of now. <strong>django-uni-form is\nat it's end of life</strong>. It's done and kaput. No more pull requests will\nbe accepted and the issue tracker will be turned off shortly. Just so no\none is mistaken:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>django-uni-form is deprecated. Use django-crispy-forms</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Miguel asked if he could start the project anew, under a different name.\nWe both had been uncomfortable with the name <em>django-uni-form</em> for some\ntime, especially since it had almost nothing to do with Uni-form\nanymore. In fact, I often using template overrides to avoid the Uni-form\nHTML layout - the most common alternative being <a href=\"https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Twitter\nBootstrap</a>.</p>\n<p>We tossed around names for the project, but all of them were stupid,\nespecially mine. We are both huge fans and users of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/brutasse/django-floppyforms\">django-floppyforms</a>\n(HTML5 form widget app), so my fiancee, <a href=\"https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com\">Audrey\nRoy</a>, suggested django-crispy-forms. And lo, the\nproject was named.</p>\n<p>Right now\n<a href=\"https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms\">django-crispy-forms</a>\nhas an improved API, better performance, and supports both Twitter\nbootstrap forms 2.0 and UniForm. Adding new form layouts will be easier,\nand feature controls will be better.</p>\n<p>What you should be using now is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms\">django-crispy-forms</a>.\nDon't worry about changing over as there are <a href=\"https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/en/d-0/migration.html\">migration\ninstructions</a>\non the <a href=\"https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/\">excellent\ndocumentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Try it. You'll like it. :-)</p>\n",
