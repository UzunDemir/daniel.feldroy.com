title: Bad Bosses
---

There's nothing like a good rant to clean out the sinuses. And in this case, I'm ranting about bosses I've had during my 25 year programming career.

## Not a Good Mentor Boss

Early on in my software career I was hired by a nice senior engineer who taught me a lot. They left the company and I was transferred over to the "Not a Good Mentor Boss".

The "Not a Good Mentor Boss" just didn't have it in them to level up a junior engineer. When I would need help, they would get frustrated quickly. Eventually I stopped asking questions and started to make larger and larger mistakes out of ignorance. They got angrier over time as my mistakes compounded. So I wouldn't ask so many questions.

Yes, I was in a negative feedback loop.

Solution: Find another job

## Golf Player

> "He was a junior developer who would vanish early on Wednesday and Friday afternoons. We found out where he was going when the CEO announced he was taking over as architect over the tech team, and said that they cemented the decision on the golf course."

Solution: Find another job

## Plays Favorites

> "I know they did wrong but they're my friend."

Solution: Enough complaints emerged about this boss that they were not allowed to work with their own team for fear the coders would leave.

## Doesn't follow processes

> In a comment I was casually asked to look over a major task, but the task wasn't actually assigned to me. Two days before the delivery date the manager said I had to get it done or would get in trouble.

Solution: The boss blocked me from going on a trip planned for me by the client. The client was furious because they really wanted me at a booth. End result is the client told our consulting company to take the boss off any and all projects. Two weeks later the consulting company let them go.

## Doesn't lead by example

> You're going to have to work over the holiday season, and that includes the weekends. Anyway, I'm off to Tahoe. See ya later!

Solution: I worked non-stop for six weeks. Never got any recognition for my labor. Never did anything like again.

## Forces developers to be admin assistant

## Will you be my 24 hour therapist?
