There's nothing like a good rant to clean out the sinuses. And in this case, I'm ranting about bosses I've had.

## Not a Good Mentor Boss

Early on in my software career I was hired by a nice senior engineer who taught me a lot. They left the company and I was transferred over to the "Not a Good Mentor Boss".

The "Not a Good Mentor Boss" just didn't have it in them to level up a junior engineer. When I would need help, they would get frustrated quickly. Eventually I stopped asking questions and started to make larger and larger mistakes out of ignorance. They got angrier over time as my mistakes compounded. So I wouldn't ask so many questions.

Yes, I was in a negative feedback loop. The solution was finding another job.

While at the time I loathed him, and for years thought badly of them because they couldn't mentor me, recently I've rethought my position.

You see, there's this concept that experienced engineers MUST spend a significant amount of time coaching and mentoring less experienced engineers. But what if that's not what an experienced engineer wants to do? What if all they want to do is focus on code?

- No positive feedback
- Ranty boss

## Plays Favorites

## Doesn't follow processes

> In a comment I was casually asked to look over a major task, but the task wasn't actually assigned to me. Two days before the delivery date the manager said I had to get it done or would get in trouble.

## Doesn't lead by example

> You're going to have to work over the holiday season, and that includes the weekends. Anyway, I'm off to Tahoe. See ya later!
