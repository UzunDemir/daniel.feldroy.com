This is my every growing collection of places to go, things to do, and food to eat in Southern California

## Palm Springs

Lovely town with lots of art galleries/studios, mid-century modern architecture, and many interesting resturaunts. Walkable if you are staying near or on North Palm Drive.

### Getting to Palm Springs (Morongo stop)

I've only driven there, which takes you past [Morongo Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morongo_Casino,_Resort_%26_Spa), which in 1987 won a supreme court case making it the first Native American casino not regulated by its state or county. Otherwise a typical casino.

Reasons to stop:

- In-and-Out
- Affordable gasoline prices for the area
- Date shakes served at [Hadley](https://hadleyfruitorchards.com/)

### Things to do in Palm Springs

- Palm Springs Aerial Tramway
- Palm Springs Air Museum

## Joshua Tree

Lovely park, bring your own water and toilet paper. If you go hiking, bring a extra water. In the summer it gets very hot, we recommend the late afternoon for the most comfort. In other seasons pay attention to weather reports as flash floods can occur. If you see a flood, don't try to cross it, even with all wheel drive vehicles.
