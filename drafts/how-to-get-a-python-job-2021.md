title: How to get a Python job in 2021
---

In this video I give article for landing jobs as a Python (or other language) developer. This isn't about algorithms, which is covered in hundreds of books and articles and classes. Rather, it is how to communicate and present yourself in the best possible way.

Why am I qualified to write this article?

- I've interviewed as an applicant a lot of times
- As an engineering manager after 300 interviews I lost count of the number I've given
- Some of the things I mention are based on correcting my own mistakes
- Have led teams ranging from 2 to 120 people.
- I'm not just a manager, I've been writing software professionally since 1997
- I co-authored of Two Scoops of Django, Django Crash Course, and hundreds of articles about Python, JavaScript, Golang, Lua, and general development.
- Met my brilliant software developer wife at PyCon US in 2010.

Let's go!
