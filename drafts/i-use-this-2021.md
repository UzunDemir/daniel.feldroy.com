title: I use this 2021

I had been meaning to do this for over nine years. The last time I did an [I Use This](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/i-use-this) was back in 2012. 

So without further ado, X of my tools, specifically software.

# VS Code

# Google Presentations

Keynote is better, so is this app that turns Markdown into stuff. But Google Presentations is what we use for work so now it's what I am practiced with

# GitHub Markdown files

- Markdown is king
- Read the docs is great for most projects, but for my private works GH works best

# Vercel and Netlify and Serverless

# [1Password](https://agilebits.com/store)

For all my umpteen accounts they all have different, crazy obscure
passwords. All I need to do is remember one password and I've got
access to them. What is even better is that it allows me to look up
passwords in a crowded room - they are kept obfuscated by the password
`****` field. So much better than trying to keep it all in my head, or
relying on weird coding patterns.

# Mac OS X

I started as an Apple user:

I use Mac OS X professionally and have done so since 2006. However,
between autumn of 1985 and 2006 I used MS/DOS and Windows (deployments
usually to Unix/Linux). Not by choice but by hard reality of management
decision. In September of 2006 as I started to learn Python work gave me
an old, discarded Macbook Pro. Since then coding on OS X and then
deploying on Linux has been my pattern. I've followed this pattern ever
since, and I'm going to hit six years now as an OS X user.
